###Hiking###

1. Buy some countryside maps of Hong Kong ([outlets][1])
2. Check out some nice hikes in the area ([Hike.hk in Chinese][2a] + [HKGov][2b]
3. Hiking trails often start out in out of the way areas so buses/taxis will be most useful in reaching the trailhead. The two major bus operations are [KMB][3a] + [City Bus/New Bus][3b]

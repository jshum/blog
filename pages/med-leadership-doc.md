##Preface##

I haven't done very much in life but I have managed through very good fortune been able to lead three small teams. 

The first was my high school Interact team where our crowning achievement was to put together a one-day 100 person 10-hour fasting event. We got the job done but I was told two years later after guiding one of my ex-colleagues through her college decision process where I exposed the more good-natured side of me that she revealed to me that everyone on the team hated me, and there were apparently hour long Skype sessions where they all vented their anger towards me. Team composition : sc,jt,kl,dc,kk,nl,al (5 females, 1 male)

The second team I led was a team of two in which we were the teaching assistants for a computational molecular biology course in the computer science department. The course was run relatively successfully. Most people had good things to say about the course minus a few mishaps with two projects wand a couple homework problems. None of us hated each other after it, but I had effectively stressed most of my team and myself out after 10-hour weeks every week during the semester. In hindsight, there wasn't much we could do because of our manpower constraints. Team composition : two females

The third team I led was the CS team for MED International, which is responsible for the development of our Zanhealth software. Unlike the previous two, I was given completely free reign of the management of the team. This effort is still ongoing so I don't have much to comment about. (6 males)

Therefore, these are my leadership experiences that have inspired my leadership style. 

##Introduction##

This was intended as an internal document for my successors on the MED International team but also became a personal project. I wanted to write this down and return to this 10-15 years later and observe how my leadership style will have changed.

Since these were intended as an internal document for MED International, the tactics and strategies I am writing down are heavily modified for that scenario, a smallish CS team operating within the community of a college. 

I will try with my best efforts to generalize more but will more or less be specific to a technical team responsible for building a product within a relatively closed community. 

There are two words that I will ask you to keep in mind throughout reading this document. The first is, leverage. I have strong beliefs in the importance of efficiency, of doing the work of many with a few. That I believe is the point of human progress, right. If not, why don't we just all return to farming by hand? The point of human progress is survival but also so we can enjoy our lives and spend our time doing the things that we claim to be unique to ourselves : feeling, doing art, creating, imagining.

It is my belief that (well run) organizations are the most efficient things in the world (, that is until robots learn how to think). But organizations are efficient because they have a single purpose. I think is a strange psychological fact that people are more susceptible to mindhive/groupthink mentality than you think.

Of course, this is also incredibly dangerous. One of my favorite comedians, George Carlin, pointed out the dangers of groupthink in a very clairvoyant quote :

>“People are wonderful. I love individuals. I hate groups of people. I hate a group of people with a 'common purpose'. 'Cause pretty soon they have little hats. And armbands. And fight songs. And a list of people they're going to visit at 3am. So, I dislike and despise groups of people but I love individuals. Every person you look at; you can see the universe in their eyes, if you're really looking.” 

So it becomes even more important that the people you work with have to truly understand your purpose and the intention and motivation for that purpose, so that whatever they do, they remember what the motivation for doing all this work is. It is possible to approach this same pyschological fact with a very Machiavelian approach, which is that as long as you can charm them to believe in your purpose, you can manipulate them. A) It's not right and B) it's not sustaining either. People do change, especially in today's world with so much information whizzing around. It is getting harder and harder to be the king of a hermit kingdom

The second word is adapting to your team. That's a stupid word to put because now there's no good reason to read this so maybe I should put it at the end instead (like all other cheesy self-help books), but as I have already caveated and prefaced many times before even starting is that, there is no silver bullet. Each person is only effective at implementing his brand of leadership. Every team also requires a slightly different style, depending on team composition, depending on the task. Sometimes, the two simply won't fit. So you have to be aware, be aware of your team members, and be aware of the task and adjust when you feel a need to.

My ultimate aim in my leadership has always been to create teams that are efficient and effective at providing value. 

Hopefully, this document will be of use to you. Please send any suggestions and errata to js@shumjason.com

##Building your team##

In the case of MED International, the team was non-existent when I started so I was responsible for building the team as well. Again, many of the strategies recommended here will be more useful on college campuses.

###Figure out what you need###

The first most important aspect is always needs assessment. Determine what your task is and what you need your team to be to accomplish that task. The importance of this is to establish a baseline. Business operations and team management is riddled with compromises and determining what your baseline is will help you navigate the many decisions that you will have to eventually face.

In the case of MED International, I knew I needed a team of at least 3 or 4 to carry out development. In the ideal case, I wanted 1-2 front-end developers and 2-3 back-end developers. The numbers were somewhat more flexible because I knew I could fill in the void that wasn't being filled. It would have been best if everyone had experience but I knew I needed at least one person with experience who I could refer to for technical discussions.

###Knowing your talent pool###

Not all needs can be fulfilled, hence you need to know the market. It's the simple relationship between demand and supply. If you have no supply, none of your needs can be fulfilled. This is where personal networks come in. Tap into your existing networks and start looking around for suitable candidates. Since you can never assume all or any of the candidates that you like will join your team, the longer the list the better.

###The sales pitch###

The sales pitch can take many varying forms. Knowing your audience and choosing the most effective means of communication is best. But there are general rules to pitching effectively that can be learned. The keywords here are excitement and desirability. You are selling the team to people so the point of the sales pitch is to make people want to work for you. The way to do is to present your organization as a desirable place to work for. The people of our generation want purpose. Daniel Pink has a great book on how people are motivated by autonomy, mastery and purpose. Show how your team provides purpose. 

In the past, this has been my approach. A public presentation within the first two weeks of school followed with 1-on-1's. College students approach the first month of school like giddy little children, all wanting to do something new and different. The workload of a college student also increases dramatically within the first three weeks of school work. So friction increases dramatically after the first few weeks of school. 

At least on a campus setting, people are often considering several choices for extracurriculars. Unless you are highly specialized, very few people know that they want to join you. This is particularly true for non-skill based organizations which I contrast against things like music groups, sports teams, specialized team events like dancing, debating or religious/cultural groups. Groups that are related to organization/management all fall into the same category. 

It is essential therefore for the sales pitch to occur at the right time and also for it to be of the right content. The follow-up 1-on-1 is something I have found useful in the past. It achieves two purposes : a) it helps the candidate get a better sense of what you want him to do and what you guys do. This helps because you want candidates to know  what they are getting into. There's no point in getting people to join just to realize this is not something they're interested in. b) it gives you an opportunity to assess their abilities as well. In essence, it is an informal interview in which you are determining the fit of a candidate and also for them to determine if they are a fit for your organization. There's a huge caveat here. Interviews are worse than we think at identifying good talent. Sometimes, there are false positives (people who aren't good but you think they are) and sometimes true negatives (people who are good but you didn't think they are). That is the nature of the human bias and the inadequacy of a thirty/one-hour conversation to be a good basis of someone's fit (surprising, eh?). 

Things can be quite chaotic during this process. For me, the week where I did two pitches on two week day nights followed by many 1-on-1's in the following week was quite hectic. Recruiting is also a attention optimization problem. If you have determined there is a fit, your feeling will give you some idea of how hard you want to pursue this. Again, this is establishing a baseline for you so you can decide which efforts to invest more into and which ones not to. It's a fool's errand to try to be "fair" to everyone. You end up driving yourself crazy. 

If agreement has been reached, I usually go for another smokescreen test by assigning work immediately. It's very logical like setup your development environment. But you will be surprised how this will actually turn people away because this forces people to come to realize the gravity of the situation very soon. Again, this was particularly essential for me because I was building a brand new team and didn't really have time to train. I knew I was likely losing a few people because of being so aggressive but that is the baseline I chose. 

##Starting up and running your team##

###Establish a Rhythm###

The overarching goal when starting any team is to establish an overarching culture and rhythm that works for you. To do this, you have to utilize effective communication mediums, regularly-held meetings and business processes.

Meetings or inter-personal communication is the most effective means of communication. Something about the combination of words, inflection, facial expressions, body languages gives it a lot more explanatory power over pure text-based messaging (emails, texts), and even over phonecalls and even over video chat I would say. 

The most effective form of communication therefore are meetings and getting the team to meet regularly fosters several things : 1) it creates pressure for them to do their assigned work. Social pressure is sometimes a way to get people to do things as well. 2) it provides a platform for you to spout the organizational goals and keep them a clear vision of the future they are contributing towards. As people, we often lose focus of the goal. And the meeting's purpose is to reengage and reinvigorate your team members. Lastly, 3) it provides an opportunity for team members to bond. Unsurprisingly, if you make your team a fun place to come to, people will come. (Obviously, this has to be balanced with work but associating positive imagery with your organization is a very good thing obviously.)

So how to take advantage of the meeting? Meetings can be hard to coordinate but those are simply logistical matters. Once the meeting time is setup, meet regularly. I cannot stress how important it is for meetings to be well conducted, especially if they happen weekly. Again, there's a lot of fight for attention and you need to make these meetings interesting and effective so people don't feel like their time is being wasted. 

Come prepared to the meetings. Have answers ready. Have the discussion topics thought out. This is more important if your team is new, and you are doing most of the leading. Making the meeting a worthwhile thing for them to come to is quite important. Create a structured agenda that you follow during your meetings. This will reduce the friction of the meeting itself and make it easier for people to reserve their attention for the important parts.

It is also through these meetings that you are setting a culture, setting a tone for the pace and the quality of the work that you want. After all, the organization is to get work done. An organization that doesn't get work done is called a friend group. The enforcement of this is always tricky but I would say that the rule of thumb here is to be transparent and clear. Make the objectives of the task clear, make the deadline of the task very clear. Give room for negotiations and clarifications. But in being transparent and clear, you are removing the onus of the undone work from you, the requester, to the doer. Because after all they agreed to this task, especially after being given a chance to change details of the task. If they failed to accomplish it, then who's fault must it be? It also creates a social accountability that creates pressure for the work to be done.

Especially, if you only have weekly meetings where people meet, it is important to try to keep the momentum going. People, as I said before, lose focus easily so you need to reengage them with supplementary materials afterwards. 

In my experience, I have found it basically impossible to enforce working being done using weekly meetings alone. It has been much more successful in my experience to also include manadatory hacking sessions/hackathons on the weekend or during the week. A) This makes it easier for new members to learn very quickly by observation B) It also has the same benefits of putting people in a room together working towards the same goal. It fosters camraderie, responsbility, purpose and fun.

### Create Processes ###

####Onboarding####

Even very successful organizations do this very poorly because it happens not very often and people forget very quickly about it after they leave the onboarding stage. But do try to systematize it, either in the form of tutorials/documents/scripts or something that will make this as painless as possible.

And if you were successful with doing documentation, then onboarding should simply be a matter of passing on links included with a few good face-to-face seessions answering any of the questions arisen from reading the documentation.  

####Institutional Knowledge Management####

Part of building your culture and domain-expertise also includes creating artifacts that document that gained knowledge. An organization is only effective if two people don't have to do the same work twice and two people don't have to do the same work twice if one person teaches the other one so the second one doesn't have to learn it all over by himself again. As one of my CTO's used to say "A team's progress is measured by how much the collective team has learned in a specific time period"

Especially for software teams, GOOD documentation is not emphasized enough. Utilize wikis, shared documents to pass on this knowledge. It's good for passing on knowledge, but it's also good for reminding yourself why you went down a specific path. Our working memory set is smaller than you think it would be. 

####Software Teams Specific####

These are topics that you should investigate in more detail to help you run your team more smoothly

* Automated Testing/Continuous Integration
* Version Control System
* Project management tools/Issue trackers
* Framework/Libraries
* Designer(front-end)/Dev(back-end) separation.
* Documentation
* Agile Framework(Sprints)

##And Beyond##

###Communication###

Be fair. Praise only when necessary but never criticize. Give objective assessments on the work that was done, but instead of saying that this was bad, give constructive criciticsm on how to make it even better. It's hard to not be snarky in these situations, because you may/will feel a clear sense of superiority. But put yourself in the shoes of the receiving end before saying anything like that. People sense condescension very well, amazingly well. 

###Firing###

Invariably, as organizations are run by people, people come and go. Being effective at managing these transitions are tricky and can sometimes cause bad side-effects if not managed properly. The first one to address is letting go of people.

There can be multiple reasons for wanting to let someone go. Chief among them are incompetency, lack of commitment or a culture clash. If you ever feel the urge to fire someone, you should go back to step 1 and check your hiring process. Sometimes this is the cause of a personality change or an event-related conflict that cannot be avoided but you also need to ensure that your hiring process will screen out these things. 

Firing someone is hard, especially someone you have worked with. Fairness is hard to achieve in these situations and humanity needs to be considered too. Be fair and treat people nicely. No one expects or should expect charity but people also deserve basic human respect. If the leaving is of good nature, if the employee is leaving out of self-desire, then there isn't much to worry about unless they join a direct rival. But if the firing is intentional, then you need to plan the necessary contingency plans so that these person is not in any position to create adverse effects once he/she has been fired.

Again, this matter has to be approach a little differently on a college campus than in the workplace. Work place relationships are strictly more professional, and while college campuses are less so. So be ware of team dynamics especially in the later case. If firing will result in negative team dynamics changes, you might have to be cautious. But also be aware of having less-committed members on the team because they may be setting bad examples for new hires.   

###Successor Planning###

If hiring is hard, successor planning is even harder. There's no science in this one. If you have tried to be objective and still haven't been able to chose one person, then just go with your gut. There's not much else that can be said. Again, choose people who are right for your team.

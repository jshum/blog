what I learnt today from various articles
* Patriot's offence have been dominating these past ten years except in the most recent game because of their play calling system, Erhardt-Perkins system. The others in the league include West Coast offense, Coryell system (route tree). Allows them to play no-huddle. [Ref][3]
* Lakers have been sucking because 1) D'Antoni is a terrible coach for Lakers: he doesn't know how to use both Gasol and Howard effectively together and additionally created a lot of emotional baggage for Gasol. 2) The Chairman is a lunatic 3) Howard isn't playing as well as he should. His edge which was athleticism is now gone. The theoretically unstoppable pick n roll offence with Nash and Howard doesn't work because Howard is too slow. 4) Lakers suck at transition defence because the players are too slow and too old. [Ref][2]
* a discussion between different people on why more people aren't working in science. 1) regulation in sciences makes it extremely cost prohibitive to start out 2) the incentive structure in our society is completely wrong. [Ref][4]
* The biggest players in BI tools are still SAP, Oracle, SAS, Mirosoftand IBM. Because they have all the big clients and their data hosted on their own proprietory databases. Other vendors can only hope to use their data by connecting to them by writing dirvers. 
* College as my friend put it is all about the struggle. The struggle in balancing all the different things you need/want to do: classes, socializing, sleep
* I've lost that superman feeling I used to have as a freshman/sophomore, the feeling that I can take on all these challenging classes, do everything and do everything well.
* College professors are not necessarily good teachers. I am guilty of this often times but sometimes you raise the professor so high that you sort of forgot he's the one who needs to dumb it down for you. It's true that everyone has a different learning experience. The good professors are the ones who introduce the right amount of theory to give you generalizations but provdies enough concrete examples so the intuition/theory isn't lost on you.

<div>we&#39;re a speck of dust in the magnitude of the universe, very aptly described by Hawking, &quot;The human race is so puny compared to the universe that being disabled is not of much cosmic significance&quot;. We&#39;re infinitesimally small but we&#39;re also big if you zoom close enough.</div> <p /><div>You&#39;re not the shit but you can make a difference.</div><div>Life is a giant cluster fuck. You never know what will happen, who you&#39;ll meet. But the attitude is the same.</div><p /><div> To thy own self be true</div><div>Try your best</div><div>Believe</div><div>Be happy</div><p /><div>Successfully navigating life requires effective management of one&#39;s willpower, time and energy</div><p /><div>the ethics/meaning of human history/economics</div><p /><div><div>&quot;that lower-income Americans give proportionally more of their incomes&quot; NYtimes</div><div>what does it mean to give? a question i&#39;ve been considering as I think about my future career.</div> <div>i don&#39;t want to resign to a life of creating noise that i feel like some jobs are. i&#39;ve always wanted my job to help people in a some capacity but i never considered science as a career, such a removed way of helping people. would you consider a job of creating noise in exchange for bread or would you consider a life of making meaning even if it may not be appreciated. the answer to this question depends on your belief of your cosmic significance.Â </div> <div>how much change do you think you can bring to this world? do you see yourself as big or small, or small but big enough? does the world control you or do you control the world?</div><div>but how can you do nothing when you see the state of the world, the poverty, the pain, the famished.</div> </div>

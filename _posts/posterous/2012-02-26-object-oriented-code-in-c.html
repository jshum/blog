[[posterous-content:14YsHwLA7HHqdUXtQXuf]]<p>so it&#39;s actually possible to do object-oriented code in C:</p><div>take a look at this following tutorial</div><p /><div>it&#39;s a bit like what we did in Maze in CS31.</div><div>each method has a virtual method table <b>type</b>. and can have a private data table in a separate <b>type </b>or just declared all as attributes of the project.</div> <p /><div>the previous one was used in Maze</div><div><div>all of them were declared as constants</div></div><p /><div>the private data table is used in the following example C code:</div><div><a href="http://onestepback.org/articles/poly/gp-c.html">http://onestepback.org/articles/poly/gp-c.html</a></div> <p /><div>so a lot of languages just compile to C code as the example above</div><p /><div>so turns out that MI doesn&#39;t allow multiple inheritance BUT you can allow multiple inheritance through interfaces</div> <div>doing it this well, just doesn&#39;t give you the implementation free ride but reduces the complexity when there are things like collisions.</div><p /><div>They wanted java to beÂ &quot;simple, object oriented, and familiar&quot;</div> <p /><div><a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2002-07/02-qa-0719-multinheritance.html">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2002-07/02-qa-0719-multinheritance.html</a></div> <div><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/995255/why-is-multiple-inheritance-not-allowed-in-java-or-c">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/995255/why-is-multiple-inheritance-not-allowed-in-java-or-c</a></div>

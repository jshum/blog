Andrew Sullivan, a blogger, talks about his past ten years, the treasures and perils of blogging. To me, it does seem a bit egotistical, enamored with the romantic notion of talking to himself. but i do share similar feelings sometimes.<br /> <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/10/the-view-from-my-window-2000-2010.html" target="_blank">http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/10/the-view-from-my-window-2000-2010.html</a><p /> John Lennon, amazing in everyway<br /><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/10/john-lennons-many-lives/64212/" target="_blank">http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/10/john-lennons-many-lives/64212/</a><p /> interesting on counting tv viewers<br /><a href="http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/68805/" target="_blank">http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/68805/</a><p />essay on procrastination<br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=all" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=all</a><br /> meh! the title was good, just what i needed after feeling terrible for putting so much work off until the last minute. but the essay wasn&#39;t really. just wish wash, ok.<br />it&#39;s procrastination, so he should expect everyone to have experience with it. no need to keep dwelling on specific concepts. but good intro read i would say<p /> moderate/extreme republicanism. GOP = grand old party<br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/18/101018fa_fact_wilentz?currentPage=all" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/18/101018fa_fact_wilentz?currentPage=all</a><br /> first two pages i skipped about the john birch society<br />last few pages were more relatable to me with Reganism and current situation of beck and limbaugh.<br />a mess if you ask me.<p />the failed climate change bill. K. G. L<br /> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/11/101011fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/11/101011fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all</a><br />it doesn&#39;t make sense that officials should be allowed to make laws 10 years in advance. they are elected by their constituents to make their future better, but ten years, twenty years in advance. can that be justified? who are they to control the fate of sons and daughters.<br /> i don&#39;t like the whole idea of deal-making, of having to make swap this for that in order to gain their vote. often times, the actual deals are a step back rather than a step forward. it&#39;s only a name that the bill carries not substance.<br /> it is very clearly pointed out in the closing paragraphs. the climate change bill didn&#39;t work because of the huge influence which industries have over bills.<br />private systems work in the united states because the public system doesn&#39;t. but it works both ways. private companies are now way too powerful, which allows them to morph legislation <p /> <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/09/ff_wiredu/all/1">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/09/ff_wiredu/all/1</a>

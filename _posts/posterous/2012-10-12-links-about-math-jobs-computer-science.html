logical predicates. how to apply negation to quantifiers?<br /><a href="http://writelatex.com/11693wghpgk" target="_blank">http://faculty.matcmadison.edu/alehnen/weblogic/logpred.htm</a><p />self help posts with some really good messages<br /> <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis" target="_blank">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis</a><p /> awesome vimeo videos of people making shit<br /> <a href="http://thosewhomake.com" target="_blank">thosewhomake.com</a><p /> list of 23 math challenges. very specific  applied mathy stuff. <br />that was is broken:  <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/23_Mathematical_Challenges.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/23_Mathematical_Challenges.aspx</a><br /> a working one: <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/worlds-23-toughest-math-questions" target="_blank">http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/worlds-23-toughest-math-questions</a><br />this stuff is super interesting but is also the kind of thing that would take 10 years to just get a grasp on.<p /> a boing boing post from some time ago about the future of privacy and ownership of our code, data<br /><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank">http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html</a><p /> software engineers aren&#39;t just programmers. they&#39;re a little more than that:<br /><a href="http://henrikwarne.com/2012/08/22/top-5-surprises-when-starting-out-as-a-software-developer/" target="_blank">http://henrikwarne.com/2012/08/22/top-5-surprises-when-starting-out-as-a-software-developer/</a><p /> tips and tricks to keep in your mind when you&#39;re trying to design your next software.<br /><a href="http://gorban.org/post/32873465932/software-architecture-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">http://gorban.org/post/32873465932/software-architecture-cheat-sheet</a><p /> the whole that correlations may be good enough for our uses.<br />that some algorithms just work better by having run through more data than any algorithm that is more accurate.<br /><a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory" target="_blank">http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory</a><p /> knowledge is preparing us to be problem solvers.<br /> use it to understand, but to solve problems.<br />it&#39;s sort of hard to think about jobs:<br />on one hand: software engineering doesn&#39;t seem that appealing. i&#39;m not that interested in just programming.<br />sure programming has all the intellectual simulations but somehow it seems a little less purposeful until you reach the point of being a software architecture. programming little pieces of things here and there just doesn&#39;t sound very appealing. it only gets interesting when you can design systems but then i&#39;m not interested in that.<br /> i don&#39;t think i&#39;m a systems person.<br />but i guess it feels nice to know that i was paid ok money to learn this summer. just to learn.  <p />in my perfect world, the systems are perfect and you can run an arbitrarily expensive operations with large swaths of memory efficiently.

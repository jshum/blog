necessity of software engineering in cs<p />parsing<br />modularity<br />maintenance of code<p />to be able to dabble in more complex algorithms, you need better software engineering AND math.<br />cs is efficiently implementing automated abstractions.<p /> software engineering are the skills that don&#39;t matter regardless of which domain you are in. they always apply. being at least a decent software engineering is a precursor to becoming a good computer scientist.

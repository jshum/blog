just spent two hours on vimeo, clicking every single mv link i could find. and here are the ones i like.<div>i realize everytime i come to hk, i splurge. not money but time on the internet. just hours and hours on end.</div> <div>productive? not really. </div><div>the issue which is at play here is how do you find good material on the internet without</div><div>a) spending time to look for it</div><div>b) spending time to use/hear/play it before you decide whether you like it.</div> <p /><div>i mean vimeo is a fucking awesome site. everything here is top quality. but even that, i still have to manually click through all the links and hear for myself before i can judge, right?</div><div>there are two assumptions i make when i look at this list.</div> <div>a) i only looked through the vimeo list once. i&#39;m ignoring all the ones i have ignored and will never see.</div><div>b) i only listened to them once. i ignored the ones that will grow on me after a couple listens.</div> <p /><div>so here is the list. the ones that i didn&#39;t miss and also the ones that i listened within 30 seconds of listening to it. now that i have time, i&#39;ll add some thoughts to the music as well.</div> <div>the one thing i hate about my like of music over other art forms is that to fully appreciate it, u have to listen to the whole thing.</div><div>you can&#39;t make a catalog of music. unless u know each piece of music well enough, it&#39;s impossible to judge it just by looking at a bit of it.</div> <p /><div>apache - danger beach</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22679618?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>i would categorize it as instrumental indie. overall: mild soothing song</div><div>i like the choice of timbres, overlay of acoustic guitars, guitar effects</div> <p /><div>hooray for earth - true loves</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22253725?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>perfect song for slow hyping up moments, like fix you. wake up song i guess</div><div> interesting choice of timbres, percussive zings, solid hiphop beat, harmonized vocals</div><div>beats slowly get stronger, pump you up</div><p /><div>alexander - a million years</div><div>happy song, single man walking across land song and achieving some epiphany</div> <div>guitar + vocals with some harmony</div><p /><div>bachna ae haseeno - bolly brook</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22541365?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>interesting mix of indian music, with hiphop beat</div> <p /><div>manchester orchestra - simple me</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22379296?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>in general, a beautiful song</div><div>sublime instrumental with inspiring vocals</div> <p /><div>kenton slash demon - daemon</div><div>my favorite of this bunch</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20953938?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>mv is fucking awesome. using strings and nails to generate computer like effects</div> <div>the song is pretty cool as well, auto tuned songs plus wicked beat using string like pizzicato</div><p /><div>woodkid - iron</div><div>mv is freaking epic</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/21604065?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div> <div>organ, taikoo drum beat, brassy orchestral accompaniment,</div><div>the song is good for slow mo replays, contrast between good and bad factions, if song lyrics go well with story, can almost use as narration</div><p /><div>flashman - the proposition</div><div>freestyle jazz/techno</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20897944?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>amalgam of every possible sound.</div><p /><div>metronomy - the look</div> <div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/21286170?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>electrokeyboard, drum, indie style production</div><div>goofy sad song for a comedy. guy gets dumped by girl song.</div><p /><div> tv on the radio - will do</div><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/21051326?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><div>i have always disliked tv on the radio after that show for no reason.</div><div>their shit is pretty good in a serene setting but definitely not what i was hoping for spring concert</div> <div>his vocals are pretty inspiring. hip hop beats, story telling from voice.</div><p /><div>stanton warriors - turn me up some</div><div>mv is dancing battle between ballet, disco, hiphop.</div><div>song is  between hiphop beat, guitar solo</div> <div>pretty repetitive.</div>

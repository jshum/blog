started with engineering, just like any other kid who liked lego and thought they would like to build things.<br />there was some of that in engine 3 and engine 4, not a lot. the problem was that it just really wasn&#39;t that real.<br /> It was optimizing within some very small space, but not building.Â  <br />Even joining the car team became much less of an experience in creation than in following strict technical procedures in building tubes and parts.<p /> But i found that in cs i suppose. i created something. it was not building with hands and tools, but building with words and syntax , but building regardless.<br /> it wasn&#39;t glorious. you couldn&#39;t really show people what you had done. You could only let people interact with it through a terminal like looking at a lego house just through the door, but it was still building.<br /> Build I did, and learn i did as well.<p /> our engineering department still employs the old and traditional way of teaching engineering<br />mechanics -&gt; e&amp;m -&gt; circuits.<br />it&#39;s like a history lesson. from newton to maxwell to kirchoff, before you got to build anything.<br /> it makes sense for maybe mechanics, not really for bme, chem e, or electrical/computer e.<p />there&#39;s too much of a core. the concept should be more similar to topics. take three of these which you find applicable or interesting.<br /> i didn&#39;t liket i needed any knowledge from previous classes in the &quot;more advanced&quot; classes.<br /> you can increase engineering&#39;s allure just by reintroducing building again.<p />there&#39;s also lack of the computational science work at brown.<br />our computer engineering course is focused on teaching how to build a computer, not learning how to apply computers to engineering.<br /> matlab is still heavily used. very few people who work with C++<p />for those who want to be those who consistently cross this boundary and apply computer science to science, there is a lack of opportunities to do so.<br /> there&#39;s one computational physics class, the chemistry molecular modelling track is not very popular at all, and our only presence into the field is our computational bio department.<br />not that i should blame them. there&#39;s very little computational science in general. there&#39;s tons of semiconductor (computer/electrical engineering-related) startups, and lots of biotech startups,<br /> but how many SolidWorks and AutoCAD&#39;s are there out there? <br />compbio is just analyzing moshes of data with some ingenious insight and property of math. there&#39;s no one right answer but just different ways to look at it, which means everyone can take a stab at it. <p /> the physical sciences also differ in reaction time. <br />when i think of computational physics, i think of CAD, and all the cool finite element analysis, stress analysis things that the thing does. it&#39;s directly applicable to things you do.<br /> physics is immediate<br />chemistry is a bit slower. <br />biology is generations long. because biology encompasses physics and chemistry.

i spent most of the day understanding the project, then tried to do a UML<p />three types of diagrams that every programmer should or might need to use: Class daigram, Sequence diagram, Case diagram.<br /><a href="http://modeling-languages.com/uml-tools/" target="_blank">http://modeling-languages.com/uml-tools/</a><br /> <a href="http://modeling-languages.com/uml-tools-textual-notations-define-uml-models/" target="_blank">http://modeling-languages.com/uml-tools-textual-notations-define-uml-models/</a><p /> argoUML is not very user-friendly. UML i thought was a language, feels more like a basic framework that is now bloated.Â  <br />just spent some time finding some UML diagram creators that only use text. here is the one that doesn&#39;t require a windows to run.<p /> <a href="http://cruise.site.uottawa.ca/umpleonline/" target="_blank">http://cruise.site.uottawa.ca/umpleonline/</a><br />it&#39;s pretty awesome<br />bookmarkable URL allows you to open it all from cloud.<br />you can generate PHP code but the code is a bit bloated as well. every single getter and setter there is.<br /> the only drawback is that it&#39;s capabilities are quite limited in that it only supports class diagrams. <br />the syntax for writing is exactly like defining a class in Java.<br />lags indefinitely when you have an error. &lt;- PROBLEM<p /> quick sequence diagram editor<br />pretty simple syntax, clean interface, diagrams produced are nice but the drawback is it only produces sequence diagram<p />when have access to linux, otherwise to take a look at<br /> TextUMLtoolkit: <a href="http://abstratt.com/" target="_blank">http://abstratt.com/</a> - eclipse plugin<br /> DSL for UML: <a href="http://macroexpand.org/doku.php/articles:uml-sequence-diagram-dsl-txl:start" target="_blank">http://macroexpand.org/doku.php/articles:uml-sequence-diagram-dsl-txl:start</a> - Requires lots of external packages on linux<br /> UML graph: <a href="http://www.umlgraph.org/" target="_blank">http://www.umlgraph.org/</a> - seems the most polished. tried downloading the jar. can&#39;t seem to launch it<p />i&#39;ve always in the past used Latex packages. look through the sites many times. none of them seem to be perfect for the job. <p /> bonus link:<br /><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/where-to-get-cool-t-shirts-online/" target="_blank">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/where-to-get-cool-t-shirts-online/</a>

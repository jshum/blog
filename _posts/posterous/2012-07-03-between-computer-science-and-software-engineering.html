[[posterous-content:AUhtTXOvJeNIbBAHskTN]]<p>been always interested in a good definition of computer science<br />here&#39;s a good one on the attached pdf<p />Computer Science is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical processes (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information, whether such information is encoded in bits and bytes in a computer memory or transcribed in genes and protein structures in a human cell. The fundamental question underlying all of computing is: what computational processes can be efficiently automated and implemented?<p /> To tackle this seemingly simple question, computer scientists work in many complementary areas. They study the very nature of computing to determine which problems are (or are not) computable. They compare various algorithms to determine if they provide a correct and efficient solution to a concrete problem. They design programming languages to enable the specification and expression of such algorithms. They design, evaluate, and build computer systems that can efficiently execute such specifications. And, they apply such algorithms to important application domains.<p /> and another one from <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/what-is-computer-science.htm">http://www.pgbovine.net/what-is-computer-science.htm</a><br />Efficiently Implementing Automated Abstractions<p />the application in the first part of the definition and efficiently implementing part of the second part is what closer to the meaning of programming, or i guess what you could call software engineering<br /> programming is frustrating because the amount of time is dependent on so many factors.<br />but then you need to be a good programmer to be a good computer scientist. or at least i think it&#39;s important. <br /></p>

This list includes: <p />  * Statistics, some of which is covered in my discrete math book, <br />but it's really a discipline of its own. A pretty important one, too, <br />but hopefully it needs no introduction. <p />  * Algebra and Linear Algebra (i.e., matrices). They should teach <br />Linear Algebra immediately after algebra. It's pretty easy, and it's <br />amazingly useful in all sorts of domains, including machine learning. <p />  * Mathematical Logic. I have a really cool totally unreadable book <br />on the subject by Stephen Kleene, the inventor of the Kleene closure <br />and, as far as I know, Kleenex. Don't read that one. I swear I've <br />tried 20 times, and never made it past chapter 2. If anyone has a <br />recommendation for a better introduction to this field, please post a <br />comment. It's obviously important stuff, though. <p />  * Information Theory and Kolmogorov Complexity. Weird, eh? I bet <br />none of your high schools taught either of those. They're both pretty <br />new. Information theory is (veeery roughly) about data compression, <br />and Kolmogorov Complexity is (also roughly) about algorithmic <br />complexity. I.e., how small you can you make it, how long will it <br />take, how elegant can the program or data structure be, things like <br />that. They're both fun, interesting and useful.

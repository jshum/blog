money is one of those things you would like to have, can&#39;t do without, but acquiring it for itself is meaningless. <p />so i&#39;ve done quite a bit of travelling lately. and i think i should and can start doing more next year. so here are some plans for that<br /> student advantage card: just bought a 3year one. benefits on greyhound and amtrak.<p />bux tickets for east coast<br /><a href="http://nymag.com/guides/cheap/bustickets/" target="_blank">http://nymag.com/guides/cheap/bustickets/</a><p /> how to get out of providence<br /><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=1775940" target="_blank">http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=1775940</a><p />how to make money off amtrak<br /> <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/view/amtrak.com" target="_blank">http://www.retailmenot.com/view/amtrak.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.railserve.com/amtrak_coupons.html" target="_blank">http://www.railserve.com/amtrak_coupons.html</a><p /> make sure you book things three days in advance on amtrak. that&#39;s all<p /> having said that, a miser never ends up being a millionaire.<br />it&#39;s weird.

Modern, advanced democracies strive to deliver as much prosperity as possible to as many people as possible for as long as possible. They are in the business of creating perpetual booms. The cruel contradiction is that this promise itself may become a source of instability because the more it is attained, the more people begin acting in ways that ultimately invite its destruction&quot;</div><div> <p /><div><span style="font-family: georgia, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(54, 54, 54); line-height: 21px;">&quot;The quest for ever-more and ever-better prosperity subverts itself. It might be better to tolerate more frequent, milder recessions and financial setbacks than to strive for a sustained prosperity that, though superficially more appealing, is unattainable and ends in a devastating bust. That&#39;s a central implication of the crisis, but it poses hard political and economic questions that haven&#39;t yet been asked, let alone answered.&quot;</span></div> </div>

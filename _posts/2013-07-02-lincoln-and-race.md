I got interested in Lincoln after the recent DOMA strike down. I have been thinking a lot about rights in the context of social darwinism and was wondering how Lincoln achieved his success with abolition. From the brief amount I've read on Wikipedia and these few articles that I found, I have some bullet points I wanted to share

* Lincoln wasn't the lone figure who opposed slavery during his time despite what we were told in 5th Grade history.
* In fact, Lincoln was actually one of the more moderate abolitionists during his time
* During his time as a lawyer, Lincoln actually represented both sides of the slave trade in Springfield.
* He defended black property owners in the North, fugitive slaves but also prosecuted on behalf of slave owners who were trying to reclaim their fugitive slaves
* During his campaign for Illinois senator, he was criticized by his adversary Stephen Douglas in a series of debates as a radical abolitionist to which he responded “I am not, nor have ever been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.”
* During his presidential campaign, the Republican party and his position on slavery was "[it is ] an evil not be extended, but to be tolerated and protected" in places where it already existed "This is all Republicans ask -- all Republicans desire -- in relation to slavery,"
* He saw it as a policy that gave Southern plantation owners an unfair economic advantage.
* Some claim that Lincoln personally objected to slavery but it was not apparent he cared much for equality between the two races.
* But it was during the civil war where his views changed
* He was able to start race-free conscription because he knew this would be the difference that would help the union win the war.
* He had also unpopularity rescinded decrees made by his generals that all black men in the conquered southern states were free on two separate occassions.
* His main motive for rescinding was to avoid alienating the border states and give them more reason to defect to the confederate.
* But in doing so he had said, “Whether it be competent for me, as Commander-in-Chief…to declare the Slaves of any state or states, free, and whether at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government, to exercise such supposed power, are questions which, under my responsibility, I reserve to myself”
* where he actually granted himself the executive power to do so.
* Along with this, there were many hints from his speeches during the war that the great emancipation was coming by. He did this through misdirection and decoys to make emancipation sound like a good idea and necessary for the war effort.
* It was only during the victory address of the union that he said something about voting rights for literate African Americans and war veterans because his audience contained many black soldiers and not only white protestants for the first time. By that point there were more than one hundred thousand african Americans fighting for the union. This whole idea of black citizenship was apparently the catalyst that prompted John Wilkes Booth to kill Lincoln.
* The generally accepted character description of Lincoln seems to be that he was moderate about abolition when he came into office. But his views may have slowly changed over civil war (The Changing Lincoln hypothesis), or he had just been hiding his true intentions the whole time (The super secretive Lincoln hypothesis).
* There's criticism that that Lincoln was never really about equal rights between white and black people.
* Douglass described Lincoln as “preeminently the white man’s President.” To his largely white audience on this occasion, Douglass declared that “you are the children of Abraham Lincoln. We are at best only his step-children.”
* But Douglas also described Lincoln as “one of the very few Americans, who could entertain a negro and converse with him without in anywise reminding him of the unpopularity of his color.”
* But it is important to look at him through the lenses of the social context at that point. He had inherited an American that was largely against abolition.
* He is different from Federick Douglas in that he was not an idealist but a shrewd politician. He knew that the public was not open to the idea when he stepped into office
* Through many very shrewd political maneuvers he was able to warm the public to the idea of the emancipation, which may not have been possible under other more radical politicians, and also grant himself/federal government the executive power to do decree abolition.
* And it is to that achievement that many call him American's finest president.

I think the main takeaway from reading all of those articles is that:

1. Social progress can only happen when the majority shifts sides. It is almost impossible for anybody to push social change without the public's support. By the time the Civil War ended, most of the union had shifted towards the abolition of slavery. I think that is the case with gay rights and marijuana legalization. We have public support and now we need the politicians to codify it into law. For social issues, I think law always lags behind the public. 
2. The Constitution, the Amendments and the laws that politicians/law makers work within only provide a framework, especially on issues that have not been discussed before. "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness" doesn't actually provide a whole lot of detail on what they define those words as, which means that there is a lot of freedom to justify lawmakers' decisions. In the case of common law, law is all about the accumulation of corner cases and exceptions. Judges are never
impartial. They are only successful in masking their social intentions through legal jargon and precendents. 
3. SCOTUS as in all common law legal systems has lots and lots of power because there is no jury. What they decide essentially becomes law, or one of the many precedence that future cases will have to be compared against.  Even though SCOTUS has the ability to overturn previous decisions made by SCOTUS, it is also increasingly difficult to overturn because there have been so many precedents (now on issues like abortion) that it requires good reason on why this time is different.
Finding the legal reasons to support those decisions will again lead to more exceptions and corner cases. [10 overturned supreme court cases][scotus]
4. I think the view has been that members of SCOTUS are legal experts that are given the time to consider the full camficiations on each case they preside on. It shouldn't be surprising that as humans, judges are always partial and opinionated. Instead of being aloof, I think members of SCOTUS need to be the most engaged in society and actively trying to understand the predominant views, rather than being the last stand for archaic laws.
5. This is a thought that might very well be wrong. We need to accept that legislature is never perfect. There are no universal laws as we might like. As society improves, people change and so do laws. But I wonder if the majority has even been wrong? Has SCOTUS ever made a decision which initially was unpopular with the people but later became popular?
6. I've been having a lot of thoughts about the people vs experts. Government officials are playing the role of experts in governance, especially recently in issues like PRISM but are they right? The argument they've been using is that THEY KNOW BETTER BECAUSE THEY KNOW STH WE DON'T. I would like to mention the outcome of the chess match between Kasparov as a sort of related tangent, the greatest chess master to ever play the game and The World [Source][kasparov] where Kasparov
eventually won. But chess is a game of highly defined rules and he did say "It is the greatest game in the history of chess. The sheer number of ideas, the complexity, and the contribution it has made to chess make it the most important game ever played." And if we are talking about something as open as the development of society where there are no rules, why would we listen to experts?

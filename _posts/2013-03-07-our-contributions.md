How are we going to measure contributions in today's world?

As we have moved from a primarily agricultural economy to a primarily tertiary one now, and some now even talk about a shift into a [quaternary one][1]. I thought this was true due to the proliferation of software jobs that I've been observing. However, this is not well backed up by economic data. In fact, [the government economic projection site][2] actually predicts the largest job growth from now until 2020 to be 'Office and Administrative Support Occupations' by number and 'Healthcare Support Operations' by percentage. My dad says that the financial crisis in 2008 was actually an ideological failure because America realized that the economy couldn't keep growing by just having more financial service workers.  

Regardless of that, let's look at the effects of moving into a mostly digital society. We can no longer measure our output in terms of weight of crop yielded. As everything become more complex, our contributions in the overall picture become increasingly small. A realization from recent resume writing is that our contributions are going to look more like 'improve content delivery time of javscript files by 15% through cache optimizations' in the future rather than 'built a house'. Even the manufacturing of [a can of coke][3] is becoming too complicated.

>The number of individuals who know how to make a can of Coke is zero. The number of individual nations that could produce a can of Coke is zero.

We simply become cogs in just small parts of large complex operations. I'm not arguing for a return to caveman society because for any improvement in today's world requires a lot of collaborations, using work that other people has done.  To make substantial contributions in technical fields requires not only years of education and specialization, but also large teams of collaborators. The days of [a solitary genius are over][4] as argued by Terry Tao, one of the geniuses of our generation, are over.

What does this mean specifically for software engineers, my domain, though? First of all, I've been increasingly confronted by the fact that software engineering is all about [iteration][6]. Your software will never stop changing. You will keep changing it, removing lines and adding new lines. Your software will live beyond you if it continues to be developed. Traces of your contribution will slowly be erased and eroded over time. So your contributions might not even 'exist' in this world after a little while. It begs the question of the meaning of work if there's nothing to show for it. 

The contributions of software engineers will now be determined by their Github logs, which are snapshots of the code, similar to the different drafts of a book co-written by many people. Our contributions are now bits on a computer, in this case Github's servers. You could say your contribution is now permanent as long as that computer exists but at the same time, your contribution seems so meaningless now. I'm wondering if it in some ways has to do with our insatiable desire for information as predicted [by Huxley][5]? 

I think it's a common human emotion to feel that once we digitize something, the essence of it has gone. It's the feeling when we say 'there's something about printed books/magazines/wooden houses'. Or maybe this is just another sign of a human too rooted in the past and unable to give up some of the things that he has attributed meaning to.

If you grew up building Lego's and thinking about building real spaceships, what does writing software for a spaceship count as?

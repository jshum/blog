I spent an afternoon talking to my friend about relationships a few days ago. I haven't thought about relationships in a long time The question that came up a couple of times during our conversation was why are we so awfully bad at relationships? This post is mostly an exploratory post on the pitfalls in relationships.

The first part in getting into a relationship is simply finding someone who likes you. For some people it's easy. For others it's hard. To be liked, you have to be attractive. First and foremost, the easiest thing to work on is physical attractiveness. Looking good gets you noticed because that's how humans work. Also consider the idea that people get into relationship because it makes them happy. We don't get into relationships looking for sadness. An ability to make people laugh and smile, humor, is attractive. Also is the ability to be happy and having your happiness radiate to people around you. Some people are born with these traits/skills but they can be acquired.

People get into relationships because it increases their baseline happiness. We spend time together because there will be moments when you will suddenly look at him/her laughing and realize how lucky you are. But love is a drug. It takes more to get the same high every time. At first, a text message was enough to keep you awake at night. Then, it takes more and more statements of 'I care', of "I love you' to reach the same level of Serotonin high.

Everybody's brains requires a different amount of the same type of drug to have the same effect. Inevitably, one side will therefore require more of that 'I love you' drug to reach the same high. Therefore, it is often the case that there will be a difference in the amount of emotional support one side is able to provide and the other side expects. It will often be the case there will be imbalanced expectations between the two sides.  And it is also simply the case that some people behave differently in reality. Either we are not what we purport ourselves to be or the other side just expected you to be a different person.

When the rift between the expectation and the reality in either case becomes too great to ignore, the couple will try to confront that riff. If that riff is too large and irreparable, the couple will either breakup or simply realize that they can't expect that much from each other but still choose to stay together. They key is communication, in clearly outlining what your expectations are and what you are or aren't capable of doing/committing. 

People who choose to stay with each other are your typical married for 15 years with 2 children because they have been so busy putting food on the table and providing for their children that they have put their own happiness in second place. This is why some older couples get into affairs. The chase, the thrill reminds you of what it feels like to be in love again. 

But why are breakups so bad? Hearts are always broken. Someone always gets hurt. Humans are bad at breakups because of dishonesty with our real intentions, 'savior' complex and bad timing. There are two kinds of bad breakups. The first is that that one that occurs during heated arguments when hurtful words are thrown away, everything each side dislikes about the other side gets thrown out, then someone drops the b word. And once it's thrown out, it usually can't be taken back. What if the side that fucked up realized it was a bad idea, like in chick flicks. You know what sucks about real life? Real life isn't a chick flick plot. You can't come back two weeks later and expect the other person to be equally willing to take you back into their arms. Sometimes the damage is irreparable. Sometimes the people move on.

The other kind is the one where one side asks for a breakup which was not expected by the other person, then proceeds to give reasons of why it is the right thing to do. I often hear guys doing this one more. They have a long list of reasons why it's a good reason to breakup. Guys are terrible at being honest about their emotions. Often case, the true reason for most guys at least at my age is that they like some other girl or simply not having enough fun with the current girl. But they will never say that. They overthink and try to come up with many other reasons to embellish the truth. It's the 'savior' complex. I think most guys want to think that they are letting the other side go, giving them a chance to find someone better. 

They key is always communication and honesty. It's never easy to breakup with someone because that involves breaking someone's heart. Always tell the truth. Even if the truth hurts more right now, it hurts less in the long run. Be considerate with other people's heart.

If you think of relationships as a marketplace, then you start to see the problems. There's certain accepted protocols, to trial (to date), to buy (settle in a long-term relationship) and to sell (terminate the relationship). But there's no real laws barring pretty much any action. There is only social repercussion. There's no refund, no guarantee that what you see is what you get. The stakes are high. The currency we are trading in is hearts. 

May the odds be ever in your favor.

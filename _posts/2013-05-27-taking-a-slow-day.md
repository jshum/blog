sometimes there's really just no meaning to life.  
we're all just little particles running around trying to generate meaning out of our aimless running.  
you can try to understand the world, but it just changes a few seconds later.  so why try?  
it takes so much effort just to get out of bed sometimes, to get to work, to work, to come back and to make sure tomorrow happens.  
to make sure there is food on the table today so you can prepare for tomorrow again  
sometimes it feels a little pointless.  
what are we really looking for? what's all this consumption, digestion, running around, sacrificing, planning for if we all end up old and unhappy and with dreams unfulfilled?  
so let's just sit in front of the TV in our pyjamas and let today go by.

Had this idea after reading posts on Slate: [computers make scientific discoveries][2], [robot replace scientists][5]

The future of knowledge (Commuter Rail, BOS, March)
I don't think it should come as a surprise that machines are going to be a lot more powerful than us soon if not already, not that they are actually going to be 'smarter'. It's just that they will have so much more processing power that for many tasks machines will actually be able to do it faster than us even though it's not as 'smart', or as parallelized as our brains.

The aim of science has been to represent phenomena (physical/social) using symbols and equations. The end goal of science is really just a giant equation that will predict the future once we give it all the paramters, similar to Laplace's Demon. The scientific method does so by trying different hypotheses and applying it on the data. The scientific method as humans have been doing it is just a slighly more informed version of brute force. So how do we now take advantage of this with super powerful computers? Computers can essentially do the same thing. We give it a set of good data and ask it to try every single equation that it can try. If one of the candidate equations fit the data perfectly, then that is the right equation. The computer doesn't have to be 'smart' at all, it just has to do math really quickly. Computers are very good with boolean logic as they are governed by the the laws of semiconductor physics. They do them a lot faster and without mistakes. Abstract symbols and equations all just boils down to boolean logic. 

There's been a number of mathematical proofs that have now been proved using computers, Four Color Thorem, Kepler's conjecture. A lot of people have been amazed by that. There's also theorem proving assistants out there like Coq. I think it should be the least surprpising that computers can prove theorems. Because theorem proving only requires a bunch of  axioms, which is again just boolean logic. Surprising is that computers are really bad at doings that humans don't require a lot of conscious effort to do. By our evolutionary adapted brain circuitry, humans are naturally good at coordinating our bodies to navigate/maniupulate the physical world, natural language processing, process a huge amount of sensory information, fuzzy logic. But it is difficult for computers because there aren't a set of nice equations that governs these processes. Parallelized human brains process language in a lot different way than computers do. Therefore, it is also difficult for us to teach computers how to process it. We have to come up with those equations using the scientific method.

However, I do believe computers will eventually get there as well once we start understanding more of the rules. Even if there are more rules for some of these tasks, computers will still be able to do them more quickly. Furthermore, there is the fact, as [Peter Norvig][5] has shown that simply having more data is almost always better.
 
Humans have really just been information containers in the past, navigating the physical world so that two people with the same ideas can both apply their brains on a topic. Essentially, the human race is really one giant parallelized brain. different humans coming together to form new insights. In some way, we don't need to be used for that anymore. We can know move most of the heavy lifting to computers.(humans are very visual creatures. it's why we have a fear of the dark. if we were more reliant on our hearing/smell, then we wouldn't be so afraid of the dark) I think we're going to see more entertainment in the world.

I think there will be two trends:
My guess is that overall, they'll be a greater and greater polarity in amount of work done by different people because because technology has first replaced physical labour. Soon, it will also replace our intellectual labour. On one end, you'll have people who'll be doing very little and menial work. They'll probably be spending a lot more time on entertainment. On the other hand, we still need people who know how to manipulate these computers and make sense of the equations they spit out. In a free market, this will probaby give rise to very polarized income levels. Will we eventually have to move to a more central planned economic model to something like the Giver or Brave new world? It's interesting to think how it is going to translate, what role humans will have in the future world in the singularity, an eery reminder of Battlestar Galatica.

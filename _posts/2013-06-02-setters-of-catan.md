Played a couple rounds of 4-player Settlers of Catan recently. Some thoughts on 4-player game

*DISCLAIMER* : I have never actually won a round of Settlers every yet so this is my failing strategy.

* The 10 points of the winner in a 4-player game usually involves some combination of 
    * 3-5 settlements
    * longest road OR largest army, 
    * 2-3 victory points. 
* This differs a lot from 2/3 player game where you can POTENTIALLY get a lot more settlements and win on settlements alone.
* Hand management
    * It is a lot more beneficial in a 4 player game to use as many cards as you can per turn. 
    * In 2 player setting, the chance of the other person rolling a 7 isn't that high, so it makes sense to save cards have more than 7 in your hand so that you can perform a move that is more optimized.
    * This is a lot less true in 4 player setting. There are three other people rolling the dice after each of your turns. You can potentially get 2-3 extra cards per turn especially in late game. That's three more chances that people could roll a 7 which would force you to discard half your hand if you have more than 7 or make it more likely for them to steal from you as people are more likely to steal from players with more cards unless they know very specifically what one player has in his hand.  
    * There's a higher risk of saving your cards in a 4-player game.
    * Thus, it's more beneficial to use up your resources each turn, and especially in late game because you can easily have two/three extra cards each round.
* Resource management
    * The field is fairly even in a 2-player game because you start with relatively little and have a lot of opportunities over the game to optimize your position through building settlements.
    * In a four player game, the board is already relatively crowded already during the onset of the game   * As soon as you start the game the board is half full. If the board is relatively balanced, the only remaining places for settlements will be sea-side or rare dice locations. 
    * Which means where you to place those two settlements will very likely decide the main distribution of your resources for the entirety of the game. 
    * In a 2-player game, it makes a lot of sense in the beginning to choose settlements that will give you a lot of wood/clay so that you can build roads and settlements. But in a 4-player game, you can utilize trading. Which means as long as you have resources, there is likely going to be someone who will want to trade with you.
    * Having said that, if you're seen as a threat to winning, other players will sometimes cease trading with you. 
    * When choosing my first two settlements, I usually find the settlement that the highest number of points (sum of the number of dots under each number)
    * During late game, because the board is so crowded, everyone is forced to upgrade their settlements to citadels and get resource cards, this will require a disproportionate amount of WHEAT and ORE.
    * And it is unlikely that there are other players who will be willing to give away multiple wheat/ore in this stage of the game.
    * Thus, it actually makes a lot of sense to at least have one of your resources have good access to ore OR wheat even if it means it will hurt you early on. You can usually do well enough with trading to get what you need to get 3/4 settlements.
    * And start getting development cards early on. In a 4-player game, monopoly can be super lethal and road building can mean the difference of a valuable port.
* Opponent management
    * Since the board is so crowded and all the remaining positions are sub-optimal, it's unlikely that you will get farther ahead based on resource collection from settlements. So abuse the robe. The robber places a HUUUGE penalty since resources are scarce to begin with. It is very often that in some games, players that are deemed to have a strong opening position will suffer the wrath of the robber and never have a chance to become competitive. 
    * The landscape changes a lot over the course of the game.
    * So it makes the most chance to neutralize the player with the best chance and just hope that you come into the lead at the right moment
    
In short    

* choose settlement with good access to ore and wheat
* choose settlement with highest number of points
* trade a lot to get what you need
* abuse to robber to neutralize the best player
* buy development cards. if you don't get 2/3 victory points after buying 5/6, the chance of you winning is not very high.

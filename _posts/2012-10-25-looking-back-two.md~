* You control your life. be comfortable with yourself, your imperfections, your regrets. you decide who you want to be.
* Expand your universe. Realize that despite what our parents have been trying to make us believe, the universe is not about you at all. Explore far and wide. Keep asking questions and look for the truth. You have to find your own place in the universe.
* Meaning is what YOU construct out of experience. Work hard, stay straight, believe in yourself, and donâ€™t be afraid to take risks.
* You can study lots of stuffy things like philosophy and religion to decide on your way of life. but the answer is always love, love one another, love yourself.

Here are more. Some of these are simply corollaries of the above, but perhaps they will be more explicit for some people who are stubborn, like me.

* Chances are that you won't be successful, smart, famous, rich or attractive. (Not that these should be indcators of success but this seems to be the conventional set the world uses). This means that don't live your life trying to become what other people want you to be. Live it the way you want.
* You're not a self-made person. You are the result of your family, government, the time you're born in. You owe it to the world for any modicum of success you have. You're forever in debt to them. So give back. Don't have any illusion of entitlement or the American dream. [The american dream is based on certain assumptions that aren't true][american-dream]
* You won't know and you can't know what the future will be. You have to try out different things before you know what you want to do. Spend your 20s trying different things. - [Bret Victor][bret-victor-video]

Thesis: maximizing happiness in a volatile world

Observations: increased freedom for the new generation.  
evidence: mentor says, he had more freedom than his parent's generation. now we have more freedom than his generation. 

Observation: responsibilities of a human being.  
a responsibility to yourself, to be able to support your own lifestyle.  
a responsibility to your family. in the past, children had to forgo their dreams to take care of their younger siblings and their parents. for my generation, it is merely necessary for us to be at home. 

Observation: life is  all about role playing
in some ways, your responsibility defines your role.  
those who know how to play their role well will be successful in society.  
those who don't will be neglected.

Observation: who is happy  
have seen a lot of people in Hong Kong over the past few days. The one thing that has come to me is that 
there is no set formula.  
you can be happy wherever you are doing whatever given some level of material comfort.

Observation: how to achieve happiness?  
I don't think there's any way to be happy.  
If we make goals for ourselves, we end up becoming too fixated on doing this and achieving that.   
Goals are necessary for progress but they aren't necessary and can be detrimental to happiness.  
If you're in such a hurry going everywhere, how can you have time to enjoy the scenery.  
Happiness is a matter of mindfulness, living in the moment as opposed to being constantly reminded of what you have to do next?

Quote: the world is becoming increasingly volatile. we can't really expect what opportunities we will be given.
Instead, choose a direction and let life take its course.

Question: how do you decide your actions? how do you be proactive in your life, knowing everything is so volatile?  
even if we agree with the philosophy of merely choosing a direction and following it, how do we choose that direction?  
how do you make deicisions? what is your guide in life then? who do you listen to? 

My dillema is how to choose with all these additional constraints.
When you live by yourself for too long, you get fixated by your own desires and problems.  
so coming back and seeing everyone nad having to listen to their hopes and dreams for me was difficult.  
It's a bit of a rude awakening to suddenly find yourself subject to so many demands and dreams and hopes. Different from college, you are right smack in the middle of conflict, of relationships. In college, you are free. In society, you are not.  
I feel like I've always balanced all my roles well. I could do everything and now I feel like I can't anymore, because it requires me to be in two different places at once. I don't have enough energy to do all of it, and the thought of choosing is difficult.  
I don't think anyone ever enters the world without responsibilities. Responsibilities are built into our social structure. As soon as you receive any help from anyone. You to some degree owe them something, a responsibility I guess you can call it.  
And to keep it in perspective, there are many more people who have more constraints on their life than you.  
It's easy to compare yourself with someone else and say that they have less responsibilities than you. It's true in America that kids don't expect a lot from their parents and vice versa. This is what has allowed for the social mobility in the past century for America.  
Responsibilities are only constraints if you view them as chores.  
You also have to think of the benefits it brings you. For some responsibilities, you will be rewarded for it. If you're a citizen of a country, your responsibility to vote gives you the benefits of being a citizen.  
Thinking about responsibilties involves considering the biggest stakeholders in your life. 
For me, it's my family. My mother, my father and my brother. They have given me what I have and I also in return give them my life to shape. 

When in a new environment, explore until you get uncomfortable. 
Then, reflect and decide whether to incorporate or reounce those new experiences.
Repeat.

There is also another question. Can we be happy working? Can we be happy in daily life, doing something day in day out? Why is it always upon reflection, we realize happiness but lose it once we focus.
Can it just be a matter of mindfulness, of turning off all distractions during the moment. Clear your mind and just focus on enjoying that moment?

Computer science is just a platform for me. I like it because I want to learn how to leverage the power of computers. I think the future is where everything will be a computer. At the same time it is a means to an end. I want the income, lifestyle, variety that a career in computer science will offer me. 

In the end, I think you need to do something. you can't just stop. No matter what, do something. you can't know how much happiness until you do it. You don't know how much happiness some option will provide you until you do it. You can't be afraid of doing something.  

For me, I think i'm just missing a deep, personal relationship in my life.

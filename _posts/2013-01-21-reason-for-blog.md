_a new approach to blogging_

I started blogging what I was a little younger. It started as a channel to let out some of the pangs of growing up, hopes, fears, dreams and questions. 

The one thing I've realized about myself is that on some problems I never really move on. I think I do by writing a post about it, decide on a conclusion and considering the case closed. I consider it another life question that I've figured out and can move on from. But sometimes that's not the case, themes have emerged in my life and I find myself revisiting the same problems. Each time I think I've figured it out once and for all. Or maybe these are simply reflections of my mood, how our outlooks on life can switch from one day to the next, or how we change as people. 

So I decided that I need to handle this blog a little bit more scientifically. I took some inspiration from Wolfram, who in this post demonstrates how you can do analytics on yourself by treating yourself as a series of datapoints. The reason that I switched to this blog is even though it requires a little bit more work is because it gives me a lot more control over my words, which will be the datapoints of this experiment on myself.  

It's also an attempt to teach myself how to achieve inner peace. I realize that I get pretty stubborn and start worrying too much quite easily. I get fixated on little ideas that keep me up in the night but when I wake up, I scoff at the stupid conclusion that I came up with the night before. I want to counsel myself by searching my own thoughts and words. Before I start thinking too much, I can turn to the blog and say to myself, I already thought about this topic, and this is the conclusion I came up with. 

It's also going to give me a way to observe my emotions over a longer period of time. The blog will become a  map of feelings I've felt and a database of thoughts I've had. Perhaps I can look at it and find some interesting insights.

I have a few thoughts on what kind of interesting experiments I could do. I could tally all the words I use and do some kind of cloud. I could reference some database to give a numerical value of the connotations of the words I use. I could do word associations and see which words appear most often together in my posts.

and I'm also asking for your helpl. Catch my spelling mistakes, question my assumptions, please.

_adverse effects of modern life on our happiness_

The internet despite a lot of its other benefits, is making us sad. It has changed our information consumption habits. Most of us consume way too much information in a day. It leaves us gasping for oxygen, not having enough time to react or digest any of it. I skim read at least four to five HN articles every day. It isn't much but it becomes hard to remember the source of tidbits of information I have in my head. I want to create a tighter feedback loop to encourage a more responsible information consumption habit.

The advent of the smartphone also means that we can no longer live any part of our daily lives in peace. The smartphone is always reminding us of what we need to do, provides with the opportunity to not waste any single moment. We can no longer enjoy a bus ride but have to message all our friends which we haven't seen in a while. 

Maybe we all just have different tolerances. I naturally worry, similar to my mother. It allows me to be very stable and risk-averse but it also saps out the fun out of a lot of things. I guess the trick for me is to be mindful, to learn how to shut off everything and enjoy the moment, to participate more. 

but I still haven't figured out the relationship between happiness and work. Cal Newport is arguing that we need to craft our careers, which will probably involve unenjoyable hardwork to attain the skills that are needed. Is there any meaning in hardwork?

_intensity of emotions throughout our lifetime_ 

The intensity of one's emotions over a lifetime  is like a valley between two peaks. When you're young, you haven't felt many emotions before so every experience is new. Every emotion is pure and raw. When you grow older though, the intensity of our emotions lessens because compared to our youth, we've seen a lot more, felt a lot more emotions. There's a lot more stimuli to have to take in. Society, your family, your colleagues, your boss, your friends. It becomes a lot harder to hold the same grudge for a few days like we did as children. At the end of our life when our memory starts failing us, we return to the same intense, irrational periods of extreme emotions because we don't even remember what made us feel that in the first place anymore. 

_relationships_

Relationships always seem a lot easier when you're free and have nothing to do. Because the cost of the sacrifice is small so you' don't mind doing it. But realtionships require sacrifices. We get tired and bogged down because the sacrifice is too high for a reward that isn't that probable. But sacrifices are attractive because they show you care. I feel like I can change but it's easy to forget what hapepns when work starts crashing down.

I've had the blessing of talking to a lot of friends this past break and I've been saying the following few things to some of my friends who needed a firm push.  

Overcoming the initial inertia:
 
* It's fine if you have certain dislikes, you don't like going to class, or you hate reading the textbook. But you have to be realistic and try to be smart and learn how to get around your dislikes. Example:
	* Go to class if you don't like reading the textbook.
	* Read the textbook if you don't like going to class.
	* But you can't expect to not have to do both and still do well in class. 
* Get around your dislikes and find things you are interested and ways to interest yourself in them.
* Don't step into potholes if they are already there. If you do, you're being very stupid. 
* Create a schedule that helps you. Try to make it as easy as possible for you to motivate yourself to work. Don't create an uphill battle for yourself before you have begun. 
* Put yourself in a position to learn. To maximize learning, put yourself in a position where you have to learn in order to survive. Create the urgency and incentive to learn. 

How to choose a direction:

* Don't be close minded. Seriously listen to other people.  
* Be realistic. Choose a goal and think of the easiest way to get there.
* It's a basic requirement to do as well as your background, your resources allow you to. It's a basic responsibility to yourself and to all the people who have spent hours helping you, hoping you would make something out of yourself. Or else I feel bad for people who try so hard but don't do well because they don't have the same resources you do. Don't do worse, at least do as well as you should. If you do any better, that's a bonus.

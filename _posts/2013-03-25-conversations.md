A couple of ideas from conversations I've head in the past couple of days:

Is America actually really as free as we think? (GCB, Prov, March)
* a lot of things that are done in America in the name of equality, justice, liberty end up having the tototally opposite effect.
* That seems to be the common theme in America.
* Providence airport taxi cab. Only one taxi company in Providence called the Providence Airport Taxi Cab can stay in the official taxi line at the airport to pick up clients.
* Midwest Nebraska, Idaho corn subsidies.
* TurboTax spent 11 million dollars in lobbying to stop a bill that would make filing taxes a lot easier. 

* There's just a lot of crap like this where words are said and facts are pulled out so that laws/subsidies are passed.
* But if you actually look carefully at it, it's actually just a bunch of crap where the fineprint is thousands pages long and more poisonous than the benefits that the law will bring.
* Lawmakers are some very dirty people. House of Cards. To reach such a high level of power, you need to be sufficiently selfish and ruthless
* So it's all just dirty business. Lots of benefits being passed back to themselves
* [Perfect quote from Killing Them Softly][1]

China and its view of itself: (GCB, PVD, March)
* China gets a lot of bad press from the Western World.
* China gets a lot of shit wrong, but the consensus among the Anglo-saxon world is that they are fundamentally evil. 
* China also gets a lot of bad press from its own people, from Chinese citizens.
* People in China also view the state as something fundamentally evil. They always see the western world as a better place.
* I'm not a philosopher or a public policy expert, so I don't know how to measure the ethics of the Chinese policies and governance but you also have to think of China as a growing boy. Everyone around observing is an adult so they're full of good advice, but never mention their own shitty mistakes and poop in their pants stories. 

Questions for your next startup offer (Mission, SF,  March)
* The problem is that your work will be highly unpredictable.
* What are they looking for from you? Can you provide that but is that also equivalent to what you want to learn?
* What is their business model?

Academic advice (Mission, SF, March)
* The distinction between the things you want to learn in your life and the topics you want to learn about
* It's better to spent time on a professor than a topic

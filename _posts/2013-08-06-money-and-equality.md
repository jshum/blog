####Equality - why we won't get there####

Consciousness is solitary. All our thoughts and emotions are our own. There is only ever one voice in your head. No thoughts not conjured by our own brain. No feelings not arisen from our own chemical circuitry. 

Even when we share other people's emotions, it is our second-hand re8interpretation of what we have been told. Unlike Vulcans, we are unable to directly channel into someone else's consciousness to truly feel what they are feeling. 

We spend our whole lives trying to develop intimacy with other people but we can only ever get close. Intimacy requires both parties to openly share their emotions. But that in itself requires a level of trust between two people that is hard to obtain and even harder to maintain. And openly sharing your emotions is hard because we always have these inexplicable evil thoughts that we can't share, because often times they are hurtful. We only desire to share what is good and praising and flowery
but our consciousness are hardly Gardens of Eden. Intimacy however requires sharing both the good and the bad. Once, we close our communications of channel towards the other person, then they have no way to know. It's the reason that people that were once so close can seem like strangers the next day. 

Consciousness is a hollow chamber of one's echoing voice, which is why it is hard to feel someone else's emotions, that which we call empathy. It is hard enough to feel someone else's emotions when they share and when we try to listen. It's impossible when we have no desire to listen. That's the root cause of all the ignorance, all the pain and suffering we are able to inflict on each other. It's more simple than seeing other as equals. It's as simple as you can't feel their pain even when you
see it. We ignore suffering in the face of it.  We look but do not see.

Our bodies normalize every night when we sleep. Whatever you went to bed with, you wake up in the morning taking it for granted, it's called adaptability, evolutions way of making sure we are able to utilize our superior frontal lobes on new concerns our consciousness are taxed with. But it explains the non-universal desires among the human race, that some worry about food and water, while others worry about the color of their left earring today. Some like to call it the hedonic treadmill, but
in truth, it is really just psychological adaptability. 

And it these difference in emotions and concerns that leads us to have a disconnect between me and you, between us and them, that leads us to value me and your existence a little different, that leads me to value my time more than your time.

I am not trying to paint myself as a saint with all these immortal concerns. It frustrates me that these thoughts paralyze me. It certainly wouldn't be very productive for society if every single member of society engaged in long exhausting internal monologues like this. The diversity of consciousness has benefited civilization in multiple ways. It has allowed us to specialize and bring these benefits to society. But we may have passed the point where that will always be the case. We will
have to base our thinking in a larger framework if we as a human species are to survive.

__EDIT__ : I started writing this with the desire to in some way explain away my empathy. But as I wrote this, I realized that it was counterproductive because if it bothers me enough to devote so much time to think about it, then it probably will bother me again. What I wrote above is true. I don't believe there will ever be a day in society where we will truly see each other all as equals. That would require destruction of stereotypes, racial profiling, caste systems, assumed racial/gender roles
that have been by now ingrained into our society, not to mention never being able to be truly intimate with another person.  But despite all of this, I think it took me a while to realize that I will do something about it despite the bleakness of the situation. It sounds so heroic this moment, but we often do less than we set out to do, especially when our increasingly fragile bodies desire comfort. __END EDIT__

But I think at some deep connected level, we all feel that we are part of one species. We feel it's not right that another mind, another consciousness should be subject to so much suffering. But take away rational equality, rational justice, how much of this 'empathy' stuff do we really need to remove some of that suffering in our world. My point is, we are naturally inclined to shut ourselves away from each other. So the only way to become empathetic is to open those channels of communication,
to train our emotional sensitivity, and to subject ourself to the same experiences others might have to.

__We will never become Vulcans, but we don't need to to reduce the amount of suffering around us.__

####Interlude####

Normally, these two concepts of helping the world and making money would in two separate conversations. But I want to say that these two things have been part of the larger conversation that's been going on in my head. They are not diabolically opposed to each other, but yet each requires time, and time is one of those depleting resources. 

####Capitalism - a parable of money####

_Axioms_

1. We are only born with one resource : time.
2. We value our own time more than other people's time.

_Capitalism is based on the fundamental idea that we can use a resource called money to trade time and skill._

Topic: Should we make money?

_Pro_    
Money lets you buy other people's time. If you can buy someone else's time, then you have choice. When you have choice, you can do the things you like, and pay for someone else to do the things you don't. But when you don't have money, you don't have no choice. In fact often times, you will be forced to do things that you don't want to do, because most of us dislike the same tasks, boring, repetitive and menial. 
Money lets you push people around, it's like having the biggest stack of chips on a poker table. That gives you some control over your environment,  because every person wants a little bit of your chips so they too can buy someone else's time to free up time for themselves. In that way, money is a frighteningly powerful motivator. Adults know this a lot better than we do. They know that pressure of living, of simply going to work today so that tomorrow they will still have a bed and bread
and. And as my father always likes to say, 'it's nice to have options.'

And because people value their own time more than others, they won't care enough about the drudgery someone else has to go through to perform those menial tasks. This is how money and time are related in our capitalistic world. It's easy to choose the simple life. It's easy to choose the life which is at least guaranteed to give you some degree of comfort. It's easy to corrupt ourselves a little bit for that extra comfort, because we might not care enough about it now, but our future older,
more error-prone bodies which needs more attention will.

_Against_    
I can't speak for all of us, but for some of us, a certain degree of empathy still exists inside us, a certain cognition that we all belong to one species, and that it should not be the case there two members of the same species has such different life experiences. That guilt that accompanies enjoying some luxury that you realize that somebody may never experience, that guilt which accompanies us when we realize that society is really not meritocratic but about cumulative advantages we accrue
over our life [2][2]  is what makes us human, and to some degree exists in all of us. Laws came to be because of this guilt inside us that realized that everyone deserves uniform treatment for whatever actions they have performed. Laws are beneficial to the development of society, because they place a restriction on what money can do. but individuals with large amounts of cash without love to do without them, because then they can unleash the full exploitative power of money. And what
is so disconcerting is that we are never able to climb the wealth ladder unless we make someone else above us in the ladder richer. [1][1]

####Notes####

* Our existence is alone. We can never have other people's thoughts in our hand. All our thoughts are our own. We will never have other people's thoughts in our head. We will never truly feel their emotions. All the shared emotions is second hand. We cannot feel it like SPOC. Everthing we receive is second-hand. 
* We try to get close. Intimacy also requires a lot of broadcasting of emotions. Once we stop letting other people know we feel, we have no more ways to know.
* In our default state, we are in a hollow chamber of our own echoing voice. 
* It is therefore difficult to feel what other people are feeling unless we truly submerse ourselves in their experience. That quality of being able to feel someone's else's emotions is empathy. Empathy is hard for us, because of that aloneness.
* We can easily turn a blind eye to other people's sufferings even if we're looking at it, especially when we have our own 'sufferings'. 
We ignore suffering in the face of it. We look but do not feel or see.
* Our bodies normalize every night. Whatever you went to bed with, you wake up in the morning taking it for granted. That explains first world problems, our own little personal crises. 
* Our aloneness primes us for self-preservation, because our feelings/emotions/pain/thoughts dominates our hollow chamber of a skull.
* But what if we were like Vulcans and could directly feel other people's emotions with touch, or bees, such that collective/social emotions was more dominate than our own individualistic ones. 
* In some ways, our brains are too powerful, too consuming . 
* So when you can only feel your own pain/suffering before anyone else's, when five minutes of your time trying to wash your clothes feels more important than the years workers in Cambodia work in slave-like conditions to make shoes, you will realize why we value our own time other than people's time.
* It's a result of being human.

####Quotes####

* [1][1] - You cannot create wealth for yourself without necessarily paying a portion of it up the ladder. Thus, social mobility for a few of the many poor entails further enrichment of the few wealthy, which means a smaller proportion remaining for the rest of the impoverished.
* [2][2] - This argues that advantages had at T^n lead to more advantages at T^(n+1)
* [2][2] - Cumulative advantage is often summed up as "the rich get richer", and while that's true, it's not the whole story. It's more like, even in a meritocratic system where merit is rewarded, non-meritocratic elements play a role.
* [3][3] - tragedies, snowstorms, diseases bring people together because they are socialist. they hit/hurt everyone the same, which restores a sense of equality among us.

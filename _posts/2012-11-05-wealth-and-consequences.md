This came after a good lunch with a good friend, Hans. A few ideas came out of it.

how sensitive we are to wealth depends greatly on our exposure to economic differences
Our giving philosophy: give it to more direct outcomes, low risk low outcomes, high risk direct outcomes
entreprenaurial,
it's not a far stretch of the mind to think that i/we will be global elite because that's completely possible.

wealth has a lot of baggage.  
the richer people are, the more they seem to shrink back into a little world and hope nobody takes their money.

in the best world, argued by john rawls, we are in a system where all of us get a fair share of the pie regardless.  
the american dream is based on this idea as well.  
but we now realize thanks to information that this is entirely not the case.

being wealthy is now a much guiltier thing than it was previously.  
but wealth has accumulated in hands of such a few that we're now seeing people who realize they have the duty to redistribute the wealth. because redistributing the wealth is better than nothing at all. if we are to believe that 

i think the wealthy people of my generation need to talk about it.  
you're right. i don't. i was born with a golden spoon and frankly don't deserve anything i have.  
we need to realize that wealth is not important at all to our well-being.

as another thing on quora says - we don't regret becoming wealthy. wealth removes constraints and being wealthy just removes more of those constraints, so we become more of who we were.

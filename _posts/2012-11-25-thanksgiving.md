This thanksgiving, I elected to spend it in Washington DC with my dear friend Ian.
I also managed to see JL the morning I left DC which was really unexpected and extremely nice. 

When you reach an age like 20, you realize that the life you want to live is getting more and more different from your friends.

We need to start making decisions for ourselves now. There are certain nuances in situations that you just have to decide what the right thing to do is instead of hoping your friend has the right advice.

But then, thats what friends are right?
People who understand you enough, your background, your personality, that they can give you the options to consider.

Although friends are different peop,e you can still treat their lives as some kind of model for you to follow.

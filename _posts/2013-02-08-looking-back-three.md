I've been trying to condense some of the advice I've been given growing up. This is the third attempt. The first attempt is [here][wp-looking-back]. The second attempt is [here][gh-looking-back-2]

*realization of imperfection.*

* You're imperfect. but you'll get used to it. 

*recognition of free will.*
* You control your life. be comfortable with yourself, your imperfections, your regrets. you decide who you want to be.  
* "Meaning is what YOU construct out of experience."- David Foster Wallace
 Work hard, stay straight, believe in yourself, and donâ€™t be afraid to take risks.  
* You can change yourself. I wish I had someone who said to me the opposite."Sometimes you have to work to fit in. That doesn't mean becoming a different person. That means putting on a damn button-down from time to time and to throw out those ripped sweat pants. Be interested in body language and learn the social cues that you've been missing all these years." A lot of people need the message, "It gets better," but it's incredibly passive next to, "You can make it better." 

*self identity*
* Don't live your life trying to become what other people want you to be. Live it the way you want.  
* Get a personality. Don't be part of the mob. Figure out what you like and don't like.   
, You won't know and you can't know what the future will be. You have to try out different things before you know what you want to do. Spend your 20s trying different things. - [Bret Victor][bret-victor-video]
* Expand your universe. Realize that despite what our parents have been trying to make us believe, the universe is not about you at all. Explore far and wide. Keep asking questions and look for the truth. You have to find your own place in the universe.  

*relationship with society, right attitude towards other people.*
* You're not a self-made person. You are the result of your family, government, the time you're born in. You owe it to the world for any modicum of success you have. You're forever in debt to them. So give back. Don't have any illusion of entitlement or the American dream. [The American dream is based on certain assumptions that aren't true][american-dream]  
* You can study lots of stuffy things like philosophy and religion to decide on your way of life. but the answer is always love, love one another, love yourself.  
* life is meaningless. don't be a douche.   
Nothing we have is worth hurting anyone else for. It's all fleeting people. Stop seeing race, color, sex, religion, etc.... Theyre all just people, and if you try to love them you won't lose anything.

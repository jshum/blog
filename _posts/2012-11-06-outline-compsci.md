* why computers are good
	* predictable physics
	* why are they so good now?
		* num of transistors
		* persistent
		* that's ee
	* the other side: rerpesenting and manipulating information 
		* representing different types of data
		* converting between types of data, theoretical in that sense
		* extremely applied: matters only as much as it works, speed, memory
	* computer science is not about cs
	* we have this predictable machine and we abuse it
		* the concept of an algorithm
		* automation
		* the concept of abstraction

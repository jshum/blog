Had a good conversation with Kwame (then Jimmy joined) the day before one of my finals. 

###personal causes###

I think a lot of people of our generation lack a social cause they want to advance.   
if you were given 10 million dollars today to solve any social issue, which would you choose?  
which personal cause do you deeply resonate with?  
i think our generation has been shielded by a lot of problems. we grew up during relatively prosperous and peaceful times.  
but it's also a matter of growing older so you experience more.  
unsurprisingly, causes only become personal when they bring you suffering and pain.   
because you never know what life throws it you, i won't be surprised (knock on wood) if within my lifetime, someone close to me gets some health problem that will force me to become intimately familiar with it.  
so i suppose i don't feel too bad about having no answer yet. 

disclaimer : religion is always a sensitive topic. here i'm just providing another way to think of the evolution of religion in the context of human civilization.

###religion###

in the past, we simply ran away when we saw predators.   
when we became sentient beings and realized that the action was due to fear, we needed to explain it away.  
so we used religion to explain away everything that we couldn't understand and feared.  
death was one of those things.  
for evolutionary reasons, humans have to believe that they are the most important species in the world before we can justify killing other species.   
there's no better way to explain that than to say that we are the chosen ones.   
and what better way to sugarcoat death than saying there is an afterlife which is a better place for us.   
at least that seems to be a plausible explanation for why so many of the monotheistic religions have the whole concept of the chosen people and after life.   
(these are very personal opinions. I like religion for its social benefits, a lot of the emphasis on the well being on the community rather than on selfish motives, on forging deep relationships with other people, enforcing the idea of camraderie. for more, see [here][1])

naturally, when a lot of people believed in a religion, then we had organized religion, and it became a matter of power. this is especially powerful with religion,   
if you know that a large group of people believe in X, how do we exploit this belief to get people to do what we want?    
from a power perspective, it makes sense to have as many believers as we can, as dedicated as we can get them to be. jihads are sort of an extreme of this.    
the perfect example of this is the vatican. ([reddit post][2] about how the vatican thinks)   
but it's interesting to see that the organization still has to change with times. obviously the 17th century vatican is different from the one it is today.   
this has more to do with risk/reward, the future of the organization. it's not enough for the majority to have switch sides, i.e. gay marriage in america at least.   
if you think about it, especially in the instance of westboro baptist church for example : being the minority will make them more agressive and radical, and make them easier to exploit by the church.   
an issue needs to receive overwhelming public support, to such a degree that it would risk alienating the public if it didn't support it anymore.  

one of the good examples for this is divorce. used to be rejected by the catholic church, but they had to accept it in the end.  
the same is happening for gay rights and the church.  

###the future###

upon talking about this, we rediscovered the idea that the majority's stance on social issues change over time. the social fabric of the 70's is very different from what is now.  
someone brought up the crucible which is the story of a salem witch hunt which was an analogy of the communist red scare.  
the conversation took place with me, jim, irish-american, kwame, ghanian-american and me, communist chinese. we couldn't even have this conversation just thirty years ago.  
but it prompted the question of what are some beliefs right now that are just completely wrong? 

a potential list:

* animal rights (in conflict with the inherent belief that humans are superior) great piece by peter philosopher Peter Singer on this
* drugs, non-addictive drugs at least
* genetic engineering.

my idea is that humans will keep accepting/tolerating more and more different people, as long as it is working towards the advancement of the human race.  
then came a really interesting discussion : what is going to happen in the future when we have genetic engineering.  
we genetically engineer groups of people to be physically superior but have stronger traits of obedience, loyalty, or a part of the brain associated with rebelliousness shrunken.  
then it becomes a really messy situation, of whether this is slavery. it clearly benefits human race.
similar to the theme in Ender's Game. it also reminds me of the Gundam series.

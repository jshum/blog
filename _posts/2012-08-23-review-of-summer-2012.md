So I'm moving out of my summer sublet tomorrow. You could probably call tomorrow the last day of the summer. There are a few thoughts specific to this summer that I wanted to write down before I forgot about them.

1) Greatness

I had two jobs this summer. I spent the first six weeks of the summer working in Ernst & Young Shanghai in the Operational Transactional Services department. I spent the next six weeks at Brown working in Raphael's research group, working on cancer genomics.  In both jobs, I met some really capable people.

It's hard to working in academia, bloody hard. PhD students work 50-60 hour weeks for six years earning substantially below market average for what they are doing. They become experts in some subfield, and hopefully even come up with a solution or a better solution on some open problem, finally resulting in a paper. The number of papers you first have to read just to understand the current results on the problem you're working on, then, the number of hours trying to come up with your algorithm, then finally trying this on experimental data to further tweak your algorithm.

But that's what is, isn't it? Greatness comes from sweat and tears. Any person with some normal IQ can become amazingly knowledgeable about some field. It requires a lot of hard work, but hard work that is used in the right places. Greatness is about those habits you make, the self discipline you have. It's not about the all nighter you can pull tonight and tomorrow, but it's all the 50 hour workweeks you have done over the past five years. Michael Phelps is at the top because he's been swimming everyday for the past ten years. Always thinking about changing your environment and what you're doing will never allow you build the expertise and those habits.

I have this problem too that sometimes you wake up and you're tired and bored by all this same shit again without any clear goal in sight. But remember that you're on the right track. You've been doing things routinely and correctly so that it's all boring. You've adjusted your life to this new challenging task you've taken on. Greatness is discipline. And then time, every field has a different number of required hours. When you hit that magic mark, you'll be surprised how you got there.

2) Love

Sounds dumb to say this now, especially after watching so many romance movies to try to find an answer. But "the right one" is not just the perfect person. The right one is the right person who shows up at the right place at the right time. You can't control who shows up in your life, but you can choose when to make a move.

3) Life balance

It was nice to come back to Providence during the summer. It allowed me to see Providence in another light. It allowed me to live by myeslf and realized what I really ended up doing when I had the freedom to do anything. And I do realize that there is some balance missing in my life when the semester rolls around. I work really hard but I end up missing many of the life lessons about people and human beings. I think I matured this summer, more than I have in the last two school years. In my case,  the school year stops all human interaction. It all gets relegated to second place but that needs to change. I'm a human. Lessons about people need to be learnt as well.

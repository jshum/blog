Part of Series [Things I wish I knew before College][college]

####Sophomore####

Fall semester was awfully painful academically. I went in imagine I would do Engineering, so decided to take E&M. Realized I really wasn't up to my stuff, tried really hard but still got massacred while doing so.

Around November, I started seriously thinking about switching majors. I talked to a lot of different people and ended up [settling on CS][majors].

I also got involved in orchestra, where I quickly reconfirmed I had limited musical talent.

One of the more rewarding experiences that fall was doing BRYTE, refugee tutoring, where I tutored a boy named Buddha from Bhutan/Nepal. It was the first time in my life where I faced the harsh realities of the world so directly. I tried very hard to help Buddha to be something more than an immigrant forced to work minimum wage jobs his entire life. And I realized that a) [society] is unfair, and b) the barrier of language is a lot greater than we would hope and want. 

Spring semester. I switched over to CS completely, I realized that good grades would't come easily anymore because everything was harder. It takes a lot more hardwork to do well. Putting in effort is now a B. Putting in a lot of effort is an A. I started taking less demanding classes. So I started learning to listen to my body clock, toning down other commitments, scheduling around my most effective periods, optimizing my life around school work, and learning to pay attention to my mental health as well, trying not to get stressed out. One of the key lessons is to figure out how you can easily expend 80-90% of your maximum mental capacity consistently each day so that you are mentally effective over the long run.

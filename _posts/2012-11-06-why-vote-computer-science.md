title: "What to do with computer science"
tldr: "this was an early draft of a speech I was to make at my high school about computer science and college. I talk about computer science being about representing information and how to manipulate it using algorithms. And I give a very personal view of the size your ego needs to be to survive"

here is the prompt:
why study computer science and what does it mean to study at an ivy league institution.

why computers are good?
how did computers become good? science. because of natural physical laws governing predictable behavior from using electricity on silicone.
there are physical laws governing the states. we know what happens when we do certain things to it.

advances have come in two types. one is material advances, being able to fit a lot of transistors in a small area.
(storage as well)

that's electrical engineering, being able to control material even more precisely, and fit more of them on a smaller area.

the first thing to understand about computer science is that it all comes down to bits, 0 and 1. nature
only gave us one thing to play with and its dual states: low voltage and high voltage.
based on these two states and the ability to pack many of these states.
if we have two transistors, then we can store 2^2 states. if we have 1000 transistors, we can store 2^1000 states. so we can basically simulate a large large number of states.

the second one is in being able to come up with ways to represent different complexities of data with these bits.

that's computer science, how we can represent data and what we can do with it. representing of information in bits and our manipulation of it.

computer science on one side is completely theoretical and also extremely applied.

it's theoretical in the sense that all the things we've done doesn't matter on the physical system we're basing it on. all the algorithms, all the math carries over. a large part of computer science is converting one type of representation to another so that we never really care what it's built on top of.

it just so happens it's based on top of a electrical-based system which only has binary values.

someone said that astronomy is about telescopes as much as computer science is about computeres.
but we can built it on top of cell automata. 

so we now have this predictable machine we know what it will do, so we use it, manipulate it and abuse it to some of the most boringest things possible.

we apply algorithms. gcf algorithm
to find the gcf of two numbers, given a certain set of inputs, applying the following steps
and then get your output.

but the basic idea is automation. you want to give the computer a bunch of instructions to execute. 

and why? because computers don't complain and are very fast. you would cry if i gave you the job of a computer. the tasks usually involves something like you have a list of numbers, find the biggest one. that's what the computer is doing.

and computer science manipulates that predictive behavior to do complicated things. we call this abstraction.

so what's my philosophy? i am once again, one of those people who wants to shove some advice down your throat. my authority, none really.

let me at least preface with this. a philsophy is as good as it serves you. philosphies just force us to become more of a specific person, guides us to do things certain ways, and less randomness.

here's mine: i left high school not knowing really what i wanted to do, who i really was and landed in Brown.
and the thing I learnt was I controlled my life. life probably seems somewhat constrained for many of you right now, IB. but when you get to college, you really have no obligations except to manage to walk onto a podium and be given a piece of paper.

so you have four years. what do you do? it's the first time you've been given so much leisure in what to do with your life? so you think, and i realized that my life was mine.

at the end of the day, what mattered wasn't if someone else was happy, but how i felt.
you also have to approach this way. the universe isn't really about you. in fact, it's not about you at all. for the most part, people born die without the universe ever stopping, so you have to live for yourself. and what that means depends on each person.

and you don't know what you want. so you have to try different things. spend your 20 trying different things. spend your youth taking risks. work hard for things you want or you think you want. figure out what YOU want, not what everyone else wants. that's important.

it's important to be a person. no life is perfect. it's important to decide what you like, decide who you want to be friends with, things you decide to spend time on, because those will be the things that you will think about when you look back on your life. meaning is what you create out of your experience

it's all an experiment. no one does perfect the first time through. but at least human beings have this amazing capcity to self-reason. just know that whatever you do, you'll either like or justify. what i'm saying now probably won't change your life, but start thinking about the things you want to pay attention to in your life.

i am biased. all the opinions i'm giving you are biased. what i'm saying here probably won't change your life. think about what matters to you. 

we're lucky. most of us will get 3/4 years to think about this, to try different things. think about the kid who had to support his younger siblings when his dad died when he was 15. what choices did he have? none.

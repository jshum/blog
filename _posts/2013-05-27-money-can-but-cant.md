Being from Hong Kong, I know exactly what money can and can't do for you.  
Money can buy you status.   
Money can buy you comfort but not peace of mind nor happiness.  
Neither can it buy you relationships. It can't buy you care or love.  
I don't know how my mom figured it out but she has a very good understanding of what money can and can't do.  
She understands when money should be displayed or used to make life easier or to help someone.  
At the same time, she knows exactly the point at which money is no longer useful and proceeds with her personality.

title: "on making decisions"
tldr: "an older post about how to live that is fairly thought catalog-esque - a lot of advice that sounds right but upon fruther thought is very contradicting."

This post is going to be very shitty, mostly brainstorming but I wanted to put something out there to get me to start going again.

I had a good summer, honestly, probably the best I've ever had. It was a combination of things I suppose a really educational job with low stress and working with awesome people, lots of new friends introduced by roommates, and even time to exercise.

And so I came back with an unparalleled sense of optimism and hope. And shit gets hard and you accomplish less than you set out to. And throughout this has been a conversation with myself in the back of my head slowly making observations about life.

I'm a senior next year, which means I join the real world next year. My parents lived a different life than me and honestly have no concrete advice. So I'm stuck on my own, twiddling my own thumbs.

Many of these decisions, like the ones about jobs are important. You're deciding where you want to live work breathe for the next few years of your life. So these are some collection of thoughts that I have garnered recently, and will probably add to in the future.

Living life is a difficult business. It's very hypocritical and often times ironic. Requires a delicate balance.

Take anything with a grain of salt. Everyone has an agenda, comes from a specific perspective. Question anything anyone ever says. Question them about their motives, rationale. 

Accept the fact that there will be regrets in life.
But don't dwell in them. Living requires some deal of narcissism. Dwelling on past decisions doesn't help you either. Accept the consequences and move on. 

On making decisions, it is first necessary to decide on what is important to you. The only way to evaluate decision equally is to start from the same set of criterion. You might realize that you don't actually know what is important to you. Go figure that out then.

Context matters. No two decisions are the same. The choice of sending a sick person to the doctor will be different for a person where the cost is four times your wage and a person living in a country with global health insurance.

You can't not care about your life, but you can't care too much about it either. Because it's weird like that. 

Being happy is often one of the good goals to base your decisions on. But there are moments where doing something that will make you unhappy now will make you happy in the future. 

It's hard to do start doing hard things. You need to build a routine, a habit to make the act of doing it easier. Because that's life.

Optimizing on happiness is a good strategy but it's not often very straightforward happiness of which you you should be focused on. The one in 30 years, 2 months, 3 months.

A lot of things in real life are hard. You live in a society so you can't do ANYTHING you want. You will be judged by what you do and what you are good at doing. 

But do try to live mindfully. It is certainly possible to be happy about little things, about the flowers, the blue sky. So do try to not forget that. 

I don't think it's possible to just look at flowers and be completely happy. Because we don't live alone. We live as individuals. We are able to stifle our own desires for the greater good. That was one of the first criteria for living socially.

Our goals and dreams are stifled by the society we live in. Our desires are the deep fantastical ones that we don't tell anyone about. These are the ones we want to come true when we are dancing in front of the mirror to our favorite jam.

So here's the thing right. Very few people in this world actually care about how you feel. Most people are only concerned about themselves. So you need to play society's rules by a little bit before we can satisfy some of those desires. You have to pay your dues for other people to live the way you want to them.

Be comfortable in your own skin. That's one of the most important things. Find people who accept you for who you are, for the things you say, for the way you look, for the mistakes you make.

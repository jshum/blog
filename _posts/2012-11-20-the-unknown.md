title: "Turning the unpredictable into controllable"
tldr: "a simple theory of the trajectory of human advancement, slowly reducing the uncertainty in our lives, from control over the physical world to control over our inner mental worlds."

Think about your daily routine for a moment.
Think about how many things we take for granted.
I'm not trying to say anybody is spoilt. I'm just trying to make you think about some of the consequences.

The whole point of science is that if we can extract some pattern from a random series of data points. And society utilizes this to reduce the amount of randomness in our lives.

Think about lives at every pont of civilization. 
When we were hunters, we couldn't take for granted we would have good the next day and we would be alive the next day. So we figured out the pattern of growing crops and invented farming.
When we were farming, we couldn't take for granted growing food over the winter, so we figured out the pattern of processing food so it would stay good. We invited food silos and curing and pickling.
Think about the Middle Ages, the type of things that people couldn't take for granted: a child will survive until chilhood, a mother won't die from childbirth. Slowly, we patterned everything. We made them into rules, laws, protocols, bodies of study.

So today we live in a world under the illusion of guarantee of enough food, clean water, medical treatment, liberty, freedom of speech. But waking up one day and not having these guarantees.

That's war, that's disease. How do you plan your life anymore if you don't kow what happens.

The point is that our lives are a lot more regimented than what human life started with. This pattern is going to keep going. We're going to keep pattern matching.
We've done a lot of work in understanding the physical world in the past few centuries. This century is going to be dominated by understanding what happens inside our heads, our bodies, our genes, understand why we behave the way we do, determining a pattern for human behavior.

It's a scary thought that we, our behavior, are all just going to become predictable data points, but that's what science is about.

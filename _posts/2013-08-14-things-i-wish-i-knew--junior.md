Part of Series [Things I wish I knew before College][college]

####Junior Fall####

Seems to be a common theme that I challenge myself academically more during the fall semester. I take harder classes that I usually am not prepared to take, and [get stressed out accordingly][whywork].

Internship searches was on full steam at this point. Lots of questions about what the future held, [what jobs][job1] [mean][job2], what the whole college experience meant in relation to that. Lots of self doubt as well as rejections came returning. Realized that at the end of day you have to recognize your own value and try your hardest to sell yourself. Beyond that, it's the luck of thd draw.

####Junior Spring####

Took only three classes, Spent most of the semester again looking for jobs, and spent time trying to talking to friends, and spending time with suitemates.

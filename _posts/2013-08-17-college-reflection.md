*Background*   
I undertook a little project at the beginning of the summer to reflect about my college experience, to see what I can improve on in senior year and giving it more perspective.

Perhaps I'm in a reflective mood or maybe I just don't want to study. But it is worth noting that after finals, I will be 3/4 way through college. A lot happened this year and I wanted to take some time to reflect about it. It's hard for me to remember what I even was like the day I arrived on campus three years ago. That seemed like a life ago. So I wanted to use this week to recollect my thoughts and construct a little bit of timeline of my time here. I'm writing this as a letter I would
have wanted my 18yr old to have read, a story sparkled with advice. This post is also dedicated to my brother who will be a freshman in the fall. 

Advice is often presented as objective standalone truths of life. But no advice is ever objective. It's always personal, a collection of ideas and lessons that you've learnt in the past. There's always a story.  In essence, all the advice I have to give is how I have lived these three years or how I wish I would have lived these three years of college. Most of this advice already exists in some form of writing in this blog. This is just a good time to collect my thoughts.

title: "Marks of an expert"
tldr: "First part is about the meaning of being good at games, while the second part is about maturation of the processing of sensory input. Finally, are there analogous strategies for life"

Reaching a stage in my life where I'm starting to have to specialize, to acquire more knowledge in a specific domain and the necessary skills to become more productive.

You can pretty much look at any activity you do in life as some sort of a game. And by game here, I mean activities which have some given rules, and you have to determine the best move that will benefit you the most in the long term based on your current situation.  You have the obviously defined ones like card games, strategy games, board games. Those are easily-defined because they have hard rules that cannot be broken, you have a limited range of possible actions every turn which are also determined by your current situation, and the end goal is obvious and clearly stated. Most of the decision making is based on an rational thought process so there's less luck involved in them, and there's relatively little comparative advantage from one game to the next.

But, you can define all sports as such too, more often in sports where you're competing against another player/team. People consider them less often as games because there's more intangibles like physical talent that simply can't be discounted and the decision making happens a lot more quickly. 

But you can get even more general. Life (not the board game) itself can be seen as a game, career development, dating, attracting people of the opposite sex. The sandbox you operate in is a lot larger, there's a lot less hard rules as what you are supposed or not supposed to do, only guidelines and conventions to follow. Sometimes we don't want to treat these as games because there's no second run-through for our lives, and we want to think of them as novel life experiences that no one else has ever experienced. But truth be told that we as a species are a lot more predictable than we think of ourselves to be. 

There are some people really good at board games. It's so frustrating to play against them. They're really good at learning the hard rules of a game, and determining the best course of actions within the framework. Some of my best high school friends including Gushi, 7ter, Fred, McChup, Doobe and also someone I'm related to, JonLaiFun, and college friends, Jimbo, ALin are all really good. But what perhaps is amazing is that they haven't become good at specific board games, like chess grandmasters. They are very quick at picking up new games and developing strategies. I remember one winter when I introduced Dominion to my high school friends. They subsequently borrowed the set and played it (almost every day) for three weeks. By the end, they had developed a fool-proof winning strategy involving burning cards (which in fact turn out to be invalidated by some fine print because you can't actually reshuffle and draw cards from the refuse pile if you exhaust  your deck pile in the same turn.)

The natural description of this people would be smart (which they are), but I also think it's a skill that can be trained. My hypothesis is that they've played so many games that they have inadvertently or purposefully created this framework that allows them to apply the same strategies between different games. (I think most of the people I know at least probably came up with this naturally which is I would label them as smart). I think they must have some mental mind map where all these different games are connected by similar strategies and gameplay. 

This framework doesn't apply very naturally to life though. The reason being that there's no rule hard rules in life, only etiquette, conventions and fuzzy moral guidelines. And sometimes good board game players are so good at developing insanely complex strategies within these bounds that they sometimes omit the easier solution that is possible by simply ignoring a little convention. Though, I am fortunate to say that all of my friends are good at both.

That wasn't even the actual reason for the post. I had actually wanted to talk about becoming an expert, and framing an expert as someone who is really good at a game makes it easier. Experts don't think faster or more than you. In fact, they think less. They just know the right things to focus on. 
When you first start doing something that is difficult, it often involves processing a lot of sensory input to make a decision, resulting in different streams of information pouring in. So the amateur is always completely overwhelmed because there is no structure to this information. To him/her, it's all relevant and all important so they spend an inordinate amount of processing power trying to digest and process it. The first few times you do something is always mentally exhausting because there's a lot to pay attention to. But as in anything, not all streams of information are equally important. And learning to determine which signals are important requires you to slowly correlate actions/signals and the effect on the end game. That requires a) a better understanding on how actions affect the final result b) a more systematic processing of actions into themes/chunks/patterns. So when you become better, you're also get better at determining what the important signals are, and how you are supposed to react when they happen. You disregard all the irrelevant information before you even start to analyze your choices.

These quotes from the article hit the mark in particular.

> No. Experts do not think less. They think more efficiently. The practiced brain eliminates poor solutions before they reach the conscious mind.

>As they become more trained, they move their eyes less until all they have to do is glance at a few locations for a few moments to find the information they need. This is called “selective attention.” It is a hallmark of expertise.

> Advanced thinkers think in advance. The expert’s first impression is not a first impression at all. It is the latest in a series of millions. The more we learn from our experience and the experience of others — whether in chess, radiography, football or anything else — the more selective our attention will become, and the faster we will think.

*bullshit alert*

I think this reiterates the age old adage of practice makes perfect, because it really does. Let's bring back the life is a game analogy for a second. There are people who are experts at board games, there are top athletes who are experts at their particular sport, but are their experts at life, people who have developed a very comprehensive and foolproof framework to analyze life choices? 
Religions and 'the 10 things I wish I knew when I was young' or pretty much any thought catalog post seem to be doing that, giving you some kind of ultra vague rules/framework but isn't actually useful. (See also Jeff Bezzo's Regret Minimization Framework) Also that very useful highly targeted advice giving, though I honestly believe people just like talking to someone about their troubles and concerns, which I really enjoy listening to. (Yes, this is a please-call-me-if-you-have-problems request) There are also 'people who are very good at life' or 'people who make life look easy' but they all seem to me like 'feel' players in sports terminology, people who rely on intuition all the time, because many of them are people my age.

Maybe, life is a little too complex for frameworks so a hunch is all you can really get. If we all knew, we wouldn't all be watching reruns of Friends to cheer ourselves up. We often cherry pick the thoughts/frameworks of 'successful' people, thinking that if we emulate it, we can have similar success. But they're all just lucky S.O.B s. My friend Michael puts it as it's easy to locally optimize but it's super hard to globally optimize.

But I'm still determined to find some comprehensive framework though. Well at least for myself. Michael [already has some thoughts on this][1] and I think they're pretty darn good. I read them from time to time to remind myself , and I've been thinking a lot about my framework especially how a lot of things changed when I moved to the real world. But more about that later.

Two weeks ago, I was feeling pretty tired from work, pretty lonely from it. I was pretty lost in terms of the future. I was feeling that I was underappreciated, that despite working so hard, people weren't recognizing my skills. I was feeling afraid, afraid that I would end up doing some unfulfilling job that had no purpose. I didn't know where I was going. I called my parents and talked to them. And the best thing is when they come through. My dad provided some out of the blue advice that made me feel a lot better.

Here's a part of it which I quickly jotted down after hanging up the phone. Hopefully, it helps you as well:

The entry point into any career is mostly an accident
You can't really choose
Your entry point is a combination of an industry and an opportunity

What you can decide though are the things you like doing.
Your college degree, your interests are a reflection on who you have become and who you want to be. But what your career is mostly an accident

At the end of the day, you have to think about your strengths, your bargaining chip. You can challenge your weaknesses but what are people going to pay you to do.

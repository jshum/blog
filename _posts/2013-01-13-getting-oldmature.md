Let me recount what has happened to me in the span of four weeks, from the moment I stepped of the plane to the moment I will step back on the plane and go back to my room and my studies.

The moment I stepped of the plane, I was thinking about something very idealistic, about what science is and what engineering is. 
Science is about coming up with a model of something in order to understand and explain it. Science is about coming up with the most accurate model you can for something in nature.
Engineering, on the other hand, is fundamentally about building or augmenting something that already exists. There's a lot more time/resource constraints and approximations.
I also remembered thinking that to companies R&D departments are just a waste of money. They have R&D because the profit of having your own product development/improvements is greater than not investing in one. But if it was possible to generate enough profit without R&D, corporations would.  

And about two weeks later, I was having lunch with CY, I found myself saying the following. 
Businesses and technology are the two resons for progress. Technology because it allows to control more of our environment, solve more problems. and businesses because they drive out inefficiencies. The ultimate goal of a company is always to squeeze out the middleman and reap all the profit. 

And this week over several conversations with different people, especially one with VF, I found myself saying like:

Unlike the past fifty years, in which we have seen the greatest economic boom in HK/USA, the future looks a lot more gloomy. The economy of the past fifty years has resulted in an unreasonable capital appreciation especially in HK. The percentage of housing cost to an average worker's pay in Hong Kong is at an all-time high. 
it's all about value added in the future. But it's not only in Hong Kong, the same is true in USA. [Young people are really screwed][1]

People our age face a lot of financial problems.
Because of the problem outlined above, it's not possible for even relatively high income young professionals to afford a house. In our parent's generation, real esate was cheap, at least much cheaper than it is now. They made money simply by waiting a couple of years for the property to appreciate. But that won't happen anymore. 

To survive in modern society, it's not enough to simply be good at your job. One needs to learn how to manage your finances well. But as for any skill, some people are good at it and some aren't. So we're going to find ourselves in a society where some people's talents are limited because of their financial conditions.

When you grow old, the importance of money elevates. From what I've observed of myself, I've started to think a lot more about money compared to the last time I came back. I think it was the realization it is likely that despite how well I am at my job, it probably isn't going to make me enough money for a comfortable life or retirement. To put in perspective, if someone like me having my educational background is complaining, what about people who are not as lucky as me. What are their concerns?

On the other hand, because there won't be anymore magical capital appreciation as there has been in the past, some people say investing won't be as lucrative as it has been. Instead, we have to think about value added, learn how to build things again, how to make things.  

But where do I stand on the spectrum between ideals and practical, selfless giving and selfish taking? I'm not sure but I'll know the next time I look back and connect the dots. At least I realize that growing up means realizing more of the limitations, and the neccessities to survive in the real world. Growing up is, putting your dreams in context of your realities. 

I've talked to a lot of friends this break. I've been given a lot of on how to approach life, which I'm thankful for. It's given me a wider perspective, and probably will serve me once I go back to bubble.

I find myself doing the same thing at the end of a long soul searching period, I go on brainpickings and click through the [inspiring posts][bp1] by [inspiring people][bp3] about [life and happiness][bp2]. But I don't beleive in a life of endless consuming. Sometimes, we just have to do something. 

But I tranced upon a documentary on Richard Fenyman today titled [No Ordinary Genius][bp4]. A noble prize winner who played the bongo drums, did physics, drew portraits of gogo girls, travelled the world. I leave you with this, two quotes that stayed with me. 

> "I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell."

> "Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?" No, I'm not... If it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it â€” that would be very nice to discover. If it turns out it's like an onion with millions of layers... then that's the way it is. But either way there's Nature and she's going to come out the way She is. So therefore when we go to investigate we shouldn't predecide what it is we're looking for only to find out more about it. Now you ask: "Why do you try to find out more about it?" If you began your investigation to get an answer to some deep philosophical question, you may be wrong. It may be that you can't get an answer to that particular question just by finding out more about the character of Nature. But that's not my interest in science; my interest in science is to simply find out about the world and the more I find out the better it is, I like to find out..."

So it's weird that I here dicate my philosphy and views but on the other hand, such a greatman declares he doesn't have any at all but states he exists simply to explore.

>Adam Smith outlined this clearly; while two nations can each trade in their comparative advantage to their mutual benefit (i.e. one is better at making textiles, one is better at making wine), if one nation is better at making both textiles and wine, then the other nation can do nothing to compete. The only thing it can do is be exploited. Especially if we can cheaply pay to transport goods across the world so that we can abuse perpetually existing desperate pockets of the globe by forcing them to "compete" the only way they can: BY BEING WILLING TO WORK FOR SLAVE WAGES. This willingness then deflates the cost of their labor, even though the value of the labor is identical to what it would have been if the factories were located somewhere where the human beings doing the labor were required to be paid human living wages rather than treated like animals in cages.

We are obviously in the case where America is better at making most things, and developing nations have nothing to compete with. Thus, factory workers have no choice except to compete by being willing to work for slave wages, and being completely dependent on these big businesses.

>Being forced to sell your time, energies, and (in a service job) yourself for barely enough to scrape by while the man who owns your time, energies, and yourself makes much more off of you than what he pays you isn't like a consensual sexual relationship between equal partners. If you want to use a parallel, it's like being forced into prostitution.

When you have nothing specialized skill to offer, the only thing you have is your time and energy. The only thing you have to offer is your time to do something someone else doesn't want to do. Even if you do, you will only be hired if the value of your work is higher than your cost. Nothing you do to make money can be done without further enriching someone else above you on the value chain unless you have money to begin with.

Issues with modern day America. What happens when property ownership and inheritance comes in? What happens when all of the land had already been owned before you even set foot on this earth? What happens when the cost of an education to be learn the skills for a good decent job is ridiculously unreasonable? 

>Pro-tip: America likes free markets because America has the most money and influence, which means in any "free" trade, America is going to come out on top. That's how the coercive power of money works. If you have a lot and other people don't, but they desperately need it to survive, grow, and thrive, then they are going to be in a position where they are willing to work for much less or pay much higher prices, simply because they are desperate.

Human psychology also plays a big factor. It's a rat race. There is always someone else who is more hungry than you, more ready to sacrifice something for that same spot. So many of us in our generation spend countless hours doing various things without expecting any recognition for it. And that really is the reason why poverty is a cycle that we will never escape.

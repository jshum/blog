Unfortunate that after four years, we're back into this rat race agian, trying to cram all of our four years of college courses and summer internships into a page work of information.

We get feed into a database and then a computer returns if our cv contains certain keywords that the employer uses.

CV classification
software engineers:
* strong skillset
* relevant set of experiences. course project or otherwise

product manager
* experience working with users or leading projects

data scientist
* strong math background
* working with large datasets and complex algorithms

Pepole have told me that you should put more about your experiences than your courses. 
It seems somewhat unintuitive that courses that you spend 9 months out of a year on are less important than the 3 months you spend as a part time summer emloyee. 
I suppose that's because recruiters recruit from the same school, or graduates from similar schools, which means students the same classes more or less. So they encode all that coursework into a GPA and a very small list of really cool courses which you have taken, which will be relevant to the company.

What differentiates you from the next person is your summer experiences and the projects you do on your own time. Courses are a given. Everything else is what differentiates you.

And here's the thing: People who get good jobs will automatically assume they have good CV's. That's not true. In fact, people who get good jobs could have very shitty CV's but really ace their interview.

A CV also is a fit. When they return emails, they always say if your resume is a fit. That's where the keywords come in. For everything in life, it's all about a fit.

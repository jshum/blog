This is not Thought Catalog. I won't tell you ways to make yourself happier. If you want that go read Thought Catalog.

*acknowledgements* : a long heartfelt conversation with sarah two months ago that made me start thinking about all this, a wonderful lunch with adrien, my many talks with wil, anant, joyce and of course the ever wise and prescient Jim. Actually, also my metaphysics class for teaching me how to apply rational arguments to touchy feely things, and for teaching me to use examples when necessary and appealing to intuition when useful.

real life looms near and frankly, I'm a little lost. Life used to be pretty easy in the sense that you didn't have to think much. Get these grades, get into this school, get this job. But now real life is right there and frankly I'm not used to having no one to tell me what to do. It was easy before. if I did those things, I would be happy. But now no one is telling me what to do. 

As I like to quote a dear friend of mine, "It's all f****** bulls*** ,John."

and it has me now on a Tuesday night and many nights before this one questioning the purpose of life. well, there's no purpose of life as I've determined many times. so why live you ask? no particular reason. I still am alive because I'm too afraid of killing myself and I'm still convinced that there will be future moments in my life that makes all the b***** in between worth living through. (I'm really just looking forward to the sex my future selves will be having.) But if there come a moment in my life where neither of the aforementioned things are true anymore, well, let's worry about it then.

so what do you do? in the past, I would have said do what you need to survive. but that seems easy enough nowadays. cheap food and clean water don't seem to be that far away, which brings us to our next natural conclusion. life's just a ride so why not make it fun, happy one. live life to be happy.

so what is happiness? Biologically speaking, it sounds like it's just some biological soup.or we can just think of it as one of the biological responses to some stimulus. This explains why it was so easy for our younger selves to be happy. Because we haven't see much stimulus before. So almost anything would make a kid happy, especially chocolate ice-cream.

But happiness isn't exactly a formula. Even if you give it the same input of let's say "Eating your favorite ice-cream", you won't get as a result the same amount of happiness.  One reason is we adapt. Our biological soup receptors don't react as strongly when we receive the same stimulus again. It's part of what makes us adaptable, which was evolutionarily advantageous. Because a human who was always anxious, always discontent with what he/she had would be more proactive in finding food, better shelter, thus have a higher chance of survival.

So we need to do more complicated things to make us happy, "chocolate ice-cream with a hint of green tea flavor", "a girlfriend with the body of Megan Fox but the intellect of Hilary Clinton". And obviously this is where things get complicated, because a lot of these that we may want we can't accomplish by ourselves. Then, we have the additional complication of realizing that happiness is different for everyone and that getting these people to help us accomplish our happiness will be even harder. Not to mention, it's not just a matter of making your current self happy, you have to remember that your actions now have direct consequences on your future selves. So you have this balance to worry about. 

(I think a lot of us have this same secret desire of being the center of the world, being perfect, but again that's logistically infeasible and I think even the most perfect person in the world is as happy as the next person. We just would like to think otherwise.)

But we still haven't quite addressed the question of how we decide to do things that make us happy? That too is still a fairly unanswered question. Intuition tells me that if there was a universal formula for happiness, we would have figured it by now. The fact that we haven't means that there isn't likely to be one. Further more, I think few of us know what makes us happy. Society is telling us at every step of our life what we need to do to be happy. No child thinks that he will be happier if he owned a house but most thirty years old seem to. We like to be told what makes us happy because it's easy. This is why we have consumerism, advertisements and Thought Catalog. Because if we have in our head this idea that this will make us happier, we might actually feel that happiness when we do it. This is the point at which many of us stop on our journey of happiness. We just starting to have larger and more concocted goals confirmed by other people which take more and more effort to realize. The real world turns out to be a super complicated mess which complicates all the things we need to do to make us happy.  

There may be a subset of people who actually are happy when they do things that others tell them to, but I feel like there aren't many of those either. Many of us seem to want to carve out a path of happiness for ourselves.

So do the things that make YOU happy, an uppercase YOU because you live life for yourself. How do you do that? The only way to find out whether you like something is to do it. But this again seems to bring us back to the same stage of trying to do things that make us happy subject to all these same constraints that I mentioned above. Sorry for coping out there but this I guess IS the human struggle, to do so much work to make ourselves happy. 

I like everyone else want to transcend this human struggle. I want to be blissful as the Buddha, religion and all these psychics claim, which is why we listen to every word they say. I don't want to knock them but I've tried listening to a few, and I find a lot of it to be a little lofty. So it doesn't seem like it we can do this without any medical intervention. But there does seem to be some biological effects. Some people do seem to be happier, chirpier more often than others. 

But there are a few hacks that can be gleamed from this discussion. That is we should revisit old memories and friends ever so often because these people/experiences did make us happy once, and they will probably do the trick again (maybe to a lesser degree). (I think we have a high enough life living : nostalgic reminiscence to not run out of old memories). Remembering the things that you have is another simple one. Also remember that we are all human. It is sometimes kind of sad to see some of my peers and their incessant use of social media. Everyone is rushing to prove to the world that they are happy with pictures on Instagram, but realize that everyone is human, all part of the human struggle. The grass is always greener on the other side. There is no need to try to prove you're happy.

I remember Max asking me (on the eve of Spring Weekend I think) if I had a choice to be eternally happy but I wouldn't be living in the real world, would I do it? At that point, I had chosen the world of truth, but I think I'm starting to change my mind. 

But I think I shall appeal to duality to end my long soapbox. Just as we need dark to know light, we need a baseline, a non-happy state to know happiness. So we march along arm in arm in our human struggle searching for happiness.

If you ever count all the blogs/videos/images you view every day, you'll be a little shocked to realize how much information that is. It's true that we consume a lot of content every day, from the 9GAG, Imgur, BuzzFeed links to the serious blog posts, new articles. The purpose of pointing that is to remind you that the content we read everyday is part of our knowledge diet.

Secondly, it's easy to simply ingest information and retain nothing after it is removed your view. It's an increasingly important question to ask on how we can retain information because of the ever increasing amounts of information we are reading. We've moved from periodicals (books) to daily newspapers to real-time twitter, facebook feeds. 

Being knowledgable is being able to make connections between different ideas, being able to pull ideas/facts from your brain very quickly. But you need a lot of ammunition in your brain on many different topics before you can do that.

Very few people have photographic memory. So the only other way to cheat it is to ingest relevant information. Because memory is all about building associations and connections to strenghten the bonds between neurons. I find that it's very difficult to retain anything that I only understand a little piece of. 

Thankfully though, we now have automatic knowledge curation. It's called related posts and we should be happy about that. Same as to how a professor chooses readings that complement each other's views, we have algorithms that suggest related posts based on tags. And we also have Google search which replaces a topic expert/librarian by using complicated algorithms to tell us what are the best sources of information for a specific search term, which will all be relevant. 

But the best curators are still humans, which is why Google keeps track of what humans click for different search queries and uses that to update its own rankings. 

But I think the most important thing is just a simple question you should start asking yourself after you read anything that's not purefly for entertainment value, how does the information I just read/watched fit into everything else I know about the world?

Everyone's trying to measure compatibility today. Like.fm was one of the first websites I remember to capture your compatibility with another band using their 'Like-o-meter'. Today, facebook is getting us to put down our favorite brands, bands, pans so that they find compatible ads to show you. We're supposed to thumbs up/thumbs down our favorite songs so they can more intelligently pick songs for us.

But what about compatibility between humans?

compatibility is an odd thing to define but I see it as covariance between two random variables. it basically means two things behave the same way when you move from one side of the axis to the other. Similar emotions are evoked from people when they are exposed to the same stimuli. In psychology terms, this is called rapport. It's equivalent to saying 'we clicked'.

The question now though what is the ideal compatibility for two people for a relationship, by relationship I'm referring to the wide range of social arrangements from friendships to marriages. The cop-out answer I'm going to use is it depends. 

It's all about a tug and pull right? All of us are agents in each others lives. Everyone one of us is a spheres of influence in everyone else's life. Your friends and family more often than you think shape who you are. That's why it's often said that friend the people who you want to become, and friend the people whose advice you want to listen to. It comes down to whether you think/want to change. Too similar and you end up never moving out of your comfort zone. Don't surround yourself with people too similar to you because that's like hearing your own voice on playback again and again. Surround yourself with people with people who will challenge your world view.

Two of the people I respect the most are Stephen Fry and Richard Feynman. They take the idea of openness really to the extreme. They're openness to new ideas is well known. There's some quote in the documentary on Richard Feynman titled 'No ordinary genius' linked in [getting old/mature][blog1] which says something like 'Richard Feynman befriended anyone whose world view even though very different from his, was informative to his own'. That however requires a high degree of confidence, not egotistical, but confidence that they are happy with who they are, but are willing to keep listening to new points of view. It's easy to be high-brow and narrow minded, especially after reading a few thick books and going to college. But it's a lot harder to say I am who I am but there are a lot of other people out there who have interesting to say about life.

My views on the ideal compatibility between two people for a romantic relationship are slightly different. There's two main camps out there. Some say 'opposites attract'. For expert advice on that, we shall reference [Dr Phil][dphil] for some solid romantic relationship advice. I fall more under the 'similars work well together' camp. I'm not saying it's better but I'm just explaining my point of view. For two people to be a relationship, you really have to open up to each other, really share your lives with one another. Consider this from the point of view of two people living together. Things that you wouldn't care about your friend doing like not lifting the toilet seat after they're done, using the same spoon for eating yogurt and mixing coffee (I'm choosing some fairly trivial examples) are suddenly magnified beyond context because you have a much higher chance of suffering the effects of the 'undesired' actions. My point isn't to say you need to find an identical person to you, but it is to say well hey, if you're thinking about something serious, think about what's going to have to change. And no two are identical, even identical twins. (I apologize for the chessiness) It's about the many little sacrifices you make for each other. The strengthening of a bond comes from becoming more compatible, learning to enjoy the same things together, feeding off of each other's POSITIVE emotions. Good luck to you in your journey to find yours.

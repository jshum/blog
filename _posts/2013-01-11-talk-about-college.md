I spoke a few months ago about giving a talk to high school students at my alma mater, CDNIS.
I gave that talk today. I talked about applying to colleges and the things to consider when you're going to college.

The final contents of the speech are [here][1] which I followed pretty closely. You can actually see the revision history of the document [here][2] so you can observe how the speech changed over the several versions. It would nice to leave comments about what you think. I thought it was an interesting and personally rewarding little side project. I am hoping that I will have time hopefully next winter to talk about the other stages in your teens/20s, like looking for a job. 

A little note, git's version control for documents worked a little bit better than I thought but github's web interface doesn't wrap lines which makes it hard to read. 

Finally, a couple comments from my trusted advisors on my writing.

A:  
preparation is key to getting into college.   
adapting to college is all that matters  
making friends in orientation.  
that's a reflection of his path to college, the college he ended up in.  

C:  
i believe the allocation of time plays a huge role in college success.  
there is a difference between studying and studying seriously.  
shame to be an effective motivator.  
I doubt the average high school student will care about that more than the certification they get from graduating college.   

D:  
Plenty of people seem to hate where they end up going...  
But I think it's also important to mention that people can expect to do much, if not most, of their learning outside the classroom.  
it can't hurt to remind them that 1. Work experience > grades/where you go to school in terms of getting a job and 2. College is all about those nights where you stay up until 2AM debating political economy or whatever

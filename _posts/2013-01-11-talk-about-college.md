I spoke a few months ago about giving a talk to high school students at my alma mater, CDNIS.
I gave that talk today. I talked about applying to colleges and the things to consider when you're going to college.

The final contents of the speech are [here][1] which I followed pretty closely. You can actually see the revision history of the document [here][2] so you can observe how the speech changed over the several versions. It would nice to leave comments about what you think. I thought it was an interesting and personally rewarding little side project. I am hoping that I will have time hopefully next winter to talk about the other stages in your teens/20s, like looking for a job. 

A little note, git's version control for documents worked a little bit better than I thought but github's web interface doesn't wrap lines which makes it hard to read.

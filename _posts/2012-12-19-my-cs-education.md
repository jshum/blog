When I was trying to fall asleep last night, the thought that came upon me was the one about what I'm working so hard for?
What goal am I working towards? It's not about myself, but rather what world am I working for?
What world do I want to pass on to my kids and say I was proud in contributing to?

And the more I thought about it, the more I realized it wasn't the world where we could do everything from an app
on our phone. It wasn't the where I could change the volume of my speakers in the living room with my phone.

Echoing my last post, and after watching [this video about the overview effect on vimeo][2],I think it now obvious that 
I need to do something more than just assigning values to variables.
That in itself is not valuable. Computer science is only as useful as the application. Software engineering is a skill
not a subject matter in itself. 
I need to learn about science and mathematics. 
The world I want to contribute to is the one where there is no hunger, no more children dying because of malnutrition,
poverty and lack of medical attention. To do that requires something a little more than assigning values to names followed
by semicolons,

to show something is non-context free. remember to consider every single case.
to show something is not NP-complete, just show one of the languages is not reduciable to it.

I've been having a number of conversations with myself and others since I've gotten to SF and doing my internship. Chief among them has been joining the workforce, what it means, how I should approach it (because often times having the right attitude is half the battle).

Tthe first day you start(ed) working fulltime is a milestone in your life, . It's really the end of the good old days, the day you hand over the keys to your brain to someone else, the day you don't control what you want to do today anymore, where you do something not necessarily because you want to do it, but because it will sustain your existence (by paying you). 

With school, there is still a lot of freedom. You get to learn what you want. By and large, it's not that difficult to pass classes (and it shouldn't be if you're learning what you want). It takes a lot to get kicked out of school anyway.

But that's different from a job, or at least the jobs I would like to do. (I do know there's a huge layer of fat of middle management in Corporate America). You have to do what your superior tells you to do. You're being paid to do what your job description says. People expect you to be there at a certain time of the day, accomplish a certain number of tasks each week. Because if you don't, someone can decide without your knowledge, behind your back some day that you are no longer necessary,
and ask you to leave.

The ownership of our lives is no longer our own.

####Why do we work?[\[1\]][1]####

We work for pay, for money, because that's the universal currency for services/goods.  At the end of the day, we work for own continued existence. We work for our caloric-intensive, progressively frail bodies, for food on the table, clothes to wear, material comfort.

But there's something more. If I told you that you could do less work and make enough money for a basic level of material comfort, would you do it? I have a feeling that very few people would actually do it. Why? 

Perhaps, we *__are__* all working for money, for the status quo. Money provides us with something that nothing else can. Apparently, it's much easier for people to forgo a little more comfort, a little more time to work than it is to forgo some of those material comforts that we may or may not actually need in our lives. Because we always want to seem like we're making progression our life. Regressing sounds a lot worse. [It's nice to have money][money]

Had a short but heartfelt conversation with a friend a million miles away the other night.

> *J:* work isn't fulfilling because what i do doesn't help anyone directly, just helps someone make more money.  
> i don't think the effort i contribute to makes the world a better place  
> it just provides market value for them and pays for me

> *S:* ah. then if life is to be lived that way, everything changes  
> that's a really important thing you've already realized

> it's such a grown up realization to have. i've also realized also esp in sf how money buys comfort, buys convenience, buys some time and peace of mind.

> but everything changes now  
> and yes  
> and you've already determined that the money isn't worth the comfort, convenience, etc?

> i woudn't say that  
> i think it's much easier to live the comofrtable life  
> i'm still thinking about it.   
> i've been thinking about the things i would miss if i gave up this life

> true words   
> never were truer words spoken

####How do we get out of the system?####

We get out out of the working world when we have either enough resources to sustain our lives without further input, when no one wants us, or when we don't care. For most people, 'early retirement' occurs when we believe they have enough money so we can exit the system. But there is a subtle yet important difference between exiting the working world and world of money. If you utilize financial institutions like banks, then you can never really exit the world of money unless you withdraw
all your money and put it under your bed. 

If any, one of the most important lessons that psychology is teaching us is that finding a good job and loving your work is another way to cheat the system. That involves having [autonomy, mastery, purpose][2] in your job. The first two are not too difficult the achieve, while the last is a little harder. Some of that involves being an expert, some of that also involves climbing the ladder so we have to do less grunt work and have more freedom. It's nice to be at a point where it is you
telling someone what to do, instead of someone else telling you what to do.

But maybe [life is about making money][4] for better or worse. And some of you are probably thinking, 'Grow up already. Nothing is free.'

But I am idealistic like *S*

> any suggestions or thoughts i should think about?

> maybe this is too idealistic of me
> but i feel like it's not as much as a dichotomy as we think it is
> and i'm determined to figure out a way to have it all
> haha
> but i honestly don't think anyone knows the secret

This is as opposed to what the benefits of working for a company are. Organizations/company are more effective in providing value because it can reap the benefits of specialization and leverage economies of scale. Society is more effective in providing value than any individual can by him/herself.

I'm always teetering between maniac depression and complete motivation.
It comes down to this: do you think life in itself is meaningful?
That's the switch in my brain that jumps me from one mood to another.

Here's my answer for both sides of that coin. I've always realized that order matters.
It matters which one I put second because it's the one that you think and I think I have concluded with. But it's only a switch, which takes a moment to flip again.

A) 
Life is in itself meaningless

Meaning is what we ascribe to things so by definition life doesn't have intrinsic meaning. It's not that difficult to understand.

It's been [documented][small] how people who go to space have profound realizations when they look back at the tiny dot that is earth. That everything that has ever happened. All of history, every single human that has lived treaded that little dot behind our thumb. It's perspective, literally.

It's not surprising that we don't have that perspective. It's because we're living here. When we're inside something, we can only imagine perspective but can never truly fully comprehend it. How can you say earth is meaningless when it's all you see, all you breathe and all you care.

Life in itself is meaningless. We have no purpose. There is no reason for our consciouness. And it wouldn't be surprising that we were all just part of a computer simulation. 

B)
Life is meaingful.

Meaning is what we ascribe to things so by definition life doesn't have instrinsic meaning.
But meaning and purpose are evolutionary traits. The humans who didn't have it either took their lives or died off. 

The ones who did have it had kids and passed the trait on to them. So the humans who are alive now are the ones who are the most evolved to accept purpose.

But if we are to live, why live it without purpose? The argument is that there is an argument for the sake of an argument. We're not proving the assumption. We're just using the assumption.

We have choice over what we find meaingful. And because we decide our lives. We can change our lives to whatever we 'find is meanginful'.

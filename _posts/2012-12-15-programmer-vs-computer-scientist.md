I've been working with Spencer on our programming languages final project for over two months now.
The project has required a lot of time, forcing me to cut back on a lot of my other activities. 
I now find myself just casually dedicating hours a day to this giant giant project. It got me thinking about my time, and what it meant to me and how I wanted to spend it, particularly in computer science. 

To put it more concretely, you can think of it as the difference between a programmer and a computer scientist.

NOTE: For the CS majors who are reading this, I know these two constructs are very similar and there is a lot of if not complete overlap. I'm using the definitions of the terms in their most extreme cases for the purpose of illustrating the argument. 

A programmer's project comes with a spec and a deadline. The programmer's job is to write code that behaves as specified in the spec by that certain deadline. 

A computer scientist's project comes with a question and the objective is to come up with a general and robust model/system that correctly generates different types of behavior. It might require a lot of different approaches and implementations before the right one is found because of the many factors to weigh each time. There's no concern about time constraints because the purpose is to get the best model possible.  

There's a lot of 'ethical' questions that come up here. Programmers should take shortcuts to finish their task as long as it behaves as the spec tells it to. Programmers worry a lot less about correctness than about its superficial behavior. Everything could explode any moment internally but if it looked ok to the world, it's ok.

But programming languages is one of the those things that ISN'T like that. It's about correctness. It's about the general case for all situations. 
Prior to this moment in my cs career, I've also treated myself as a programmer. I have this project/homework and I have to finish it by this deadline. Do it.  And what I've realized and my partner has enforced me to do in the right way. That's the explanation of why so much of my time has been dedicated to this project but on the flip side, I've learnt so much.

That's not to say doing it in the computer sciencetist doesn't have problems. When given this giant insurmountable problem, it's very difficult to find the courage to tackle it. A programmer will discretize a task into managable pieces which makes you feel that you can take it on. The computer scientist way also is not effective. There's a lot of time and effort and probably very little to show for it.

This actually has a lot of larger implications. We can frame this in the larger question of life.

Take some time to look at the two following videos:
I watched both of these last night. The Tim Ferriss one on purpose, and the Stephen Fry one by accident.
* [Exhibit 1: Tim Ferriss][1] He is someone whom I would consider the most extreme programmer type. (His talk is from 7:00-50:00) 
* [Exhibit 2: Stephen Fry][2]  is the computer scientist. (It's a long interview. The transcript is also there. Pick and choose. I think the important ones are 'what do you believe in')

On one spectrum, Tim Ferriss talks about minimal effective units. He wants to show you can be better than the crowd even with minimal effort. Basically, he's applying the laws of marginal return and Pareto principle. Find the 20% that gives you the 80% and stop as soon as you reach that. Don't do anymore or any less.

On the other spectrum, you have Stephen Fry, the poet/scientist, the one drowning in hiw own thoughts and philosophy. He spends relentless energy and effort attacking the same problem, revisiting it again and again, beating it to utter death, but the thing that keeps him on is his utter love for it.

The programmer always looks better on paper simply because he's done a lot.
The comptuer scientist doesn't look good on paper but if you ask him about things on the one problem he has spend inordiante amounts of time on, you will be completely be blown away.

I think this question is better framed in a context proposed by my mentor:

You should be at least somewhat decent at everything, but be completely breathtaking at one thing.
I think that's what Tim Ferriss is sort of advocating. He doesn't claim that you will become a fluent speaker in 4 weeks, but he promises you to become a functional speaker. He is teaching you the way to be efficient with your time so that you can spend that extra amount of time on the ONE THING you absolutely love. 
If you take both people's ideas and run with them, it's really quite nice. You'll be good enough at a lot of things with very minimal effort but you'll be a boss at that one thing you love.

And I think that's the more important debate to have. What is the one thing you want to be a computer scientist at? and how do you reduce your effort in every other domain but still achieve respectable results?

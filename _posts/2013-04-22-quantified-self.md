1. [source][1] Saw this post on Hacker News about how to lead a Quantified Self.
2. [source][2] Zeo according to some people on Quora is the most accurate one because it actually measures electrical activity. But it requires a headband whih is inconvenient. Most of the other ones use actigraphy which just tracks movements, which apparently isn't very accurate to measure the type of sleep you're experiencing.
3. [source][3] PCMag, the publication has rankings on fitness trackers which is a little bit different from the sleep trackers. The top-rated fitness tracker is Fitbit One but it as mentioned above is actigraphy-based so isn't very informative.
4. [source][4] This other website also rates Fitbit One as the top-rated tracker.

I've been taking two mathy but not math classes this semester. A computer science class, Models of Computation, which is our theoretical cs on computatbility theory class, and 
a philosophy class, Logic, which is mainly focused on propositional logic. I will refer to them as MoC and Log to save some typing.

The classes are nice in that they are not on the topic of math, but a lot of the principles/techniques/mentalities/thought processes you learn are applicable to math.

My professor for MoC, John Savage, is a pioneer in the applying the theories of Computability Theory to circuit complexity.
His teaching philosophy for the class, which is very related to his research, is that people need to get an intuitive understanding of the models before they can 
learn the theory behind it. This is also probably the reason why he calls the class MoC instead of ToC. I think I concur on a pedagogical level but there's a few things that he should bear in mind.

This class used to be a required for all CS Sc.B majors so it was understandable to order topics based on their accessibility. But since this class can now be substituted by other intermediate level classes, you can say that a large portion of the people in this class WANT to learn the actual theory. It's not that it's bad to learn the theory by understanding the models first, it's just that sometimes the reasoning can feel a bit circular when you try to define the concepts which you already used to define/use the models.

The other thing to also bear in mind is that there used to be a class that taught digital logic and went over all the circuit representations in detail. That is no longer true so students who are taking the class wouldn't necessarily have that intuition anymore.

There are some other thoughts that I want to mention here:
We can think of knowledge as a space, where all existing ideas/theorems/facts are interacting with each other.
Each of these knowledge pieces is an object in the space, that could be free floating, supporting some other object or standing on the support of some other object. 

For mathematics, you can clearly imagine a very regular structure which has support going in every directions because theorems, have corollaries, and upon some transformation can become another law. 

In MoC, this idea is particularly prominent when we talk about reductions which basically just means that the solution of one problem can be used for the other one.

The most important piece of insight I think I got from MoC, is that different problems, models can be and should be rephrased as problems, models in other langauges. This is useful, necesary in finding structure or gaining insight to the problem.

Both of these two classes don't directly answer it but concern a lot about languages. When you experiment with different languages, you start seeing some interesting properties.
In class for MoC today, we just learnt the language to describe regular languages using +, * and 'no space' for concatenation.
In logic, language/systems are particularly important, because you have to talk about 'ideas that are concerned about the true and falseness' or things.

The line gets pretty fuzzy so it is extremely important for you to define concretely the language you are using. I personally that in learning things, half of the time is spent
just trying to learn and memorize the language.

spent a wonderful thanksgiving with friends and family in Chebeague Island, Maine. 

I have a problem, more like a tendency, a tendency to be completely absorbed in my work and anything I do. It takes away my perspective, takes away the distance.

Leaving is always nice, but going to Chebeague is always one of those things that really shakes me afterwards. 

The cause for my myopia is the result of having to optimize, having to optimize the shit out of my life, to plan down to the minute of what I should be doing. It's the problem of having too many things that need to be done and the consequencing necessity of having to prioritize ever decision I make, to make an 'objective' assessment of my possible actions on how they will benefit me more. 

Economics loves me because I'm a rational agent, optimizing my actions based on some function even though that function may be fuzzy and may be changing. Because the point of economics is to find that function even though it may be hard to find.

I think it also is based upon another realization, that work doesn't end anymore, that it keeps on coming and coming. When work isn't no longer problem sets with clearly defined answers, but open ended tasks like leading teams, starting businesses, creating products where the amount of work you can put in is determined by how much you want to put into it.

Then, this lack of perspective, the inability to  see the other things that are more important in your life causes you to be unable to extract yourself from it, so you push yourself harder and harder and optimize more and more of your time away until there is no room to breathe. 

Life I don't think should be an optimization problem, even though I've treated it like one. It should be about those Sunday mornings which you spend talking on the dining table without any topic in mind. It's those moments that we should live for.

But modern life encroaches and the pressure of surviving keeps building, the smartphones that allow us to be optimizing every moment. 

I clearly recognized it to the moment I walked into South Station on the way home last night. As soon as I walked in, I noticed all the things we have for convenience, the tv on the 24/7 news channels, fast food, the clicking clackering train board, people on their phones texting, emailing, connecting, retracting. 

And my eyes get blurry. Someone took off my glasses and all I can see are the assignments I have to do, the emails I need to reply, the people I need to talk to. Some call it stress. maybe. I don't feel like I'm going to blow up. It also doesn't seem just to be me. It seems to be everyone around me, people my age. 

On a beautiful walk down to the hook on Thursday, Anna and I talked about a lot of things. We talked about the future where we thought we would be in 10 years, the island and how that has shaped her. I outlined my philosophy which I'm not even sure is that right anymore. I said I was going to say yes to every opportunity I was given, be a yes man. But that in retrospect doesn't seem right. It places too much trust in the system, that they only want what is beneficial for you.

These point to two larger questions. Should we have decision frameworks? If yes, that what should it be?

Arguments for having a decision framework have to do with optimization. The decision framework must be optimizing on some attribute and so we can optimize our actions to maximize on that attribute. 

Arguments against having one is that, even though we often think that our decisions make a difference, everyone always seems to believe they made the right choice, which seems statistically unlikely to me. There seem to be no differences in decision frameworks, so how would one choose a better one?

Another argument for having a decision framework also is that it seems unnatural not to have one. If our decision framework was no to every third decision, and yes otherwise. We feel very uncomfortable with that. 
Arguments for having a decision framework are also that it helps being consistent. At least you can say you were consistent (although we are rarely). It's a worry for me that if we don't have decision frameworks, we are just randomly choosing, and somehow the idea of random is troubling for humans. It's unknown. It's scary. 

The idea of navigating this graph of life without any guide seems far too daunting of a task, too complicated to take on without some larger than life principles. (Maybe this is why religion, divine spirits appeal to us.) 

I am not ready to give up on a decision framework, even though the problems with having one seem to be more serious philosophically than not having one. The decision framework needs to retain some illusion that it makes better decisions but I do recognize how ludicrous that idea sounds, and also how random our decision frameworks of talking to people, getting advice, doing cost benefit analysis and throwing all of that away when someone tells you to flip a coin and you know the moment it is in the air which option you wanted to choose the entire time.

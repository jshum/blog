edit : suddenly when your most pressing concern is gone, i suddenly have all these extra cycles to start having these conversations that i haven't been able to spend time on in the last few months

what i would like to learn? 

the more i think about it, the more i think we're defined by the era we live in.
the concerns we have, the problems we're facing, the issues that go on through our heads.
for our generation, it is the question of how to find a job in the rapidly diminishing job market.
the meaning of uniqueness identity in a increasingly connected world of social media.

there is probably some worth to studying parts of history.
but isn't it hard to extract relevant lessons out of that? 
is there actually something worth learning from the classics of literature? i've read classics : the aeneid, jane eyre and i'm not so sure what i actually got out of that.

perhaps philosophy is collapsing all of that. In essence, our conflicts are one and the same in some holistic sense. 

i think our problems are always the same,

sometimes, we just get caught in awkward situations. in the perfect world, we would know how everyone else thought and would behave accordingly. but we don't, and simply a lot of conflict/ negative emotions is caused because of that.

living in the world requires us to follow a certain set of rules. to be accepted by the people at the top, you have to comply by the rules they played with. if you choose your own path, some people will reject you, until people finally see your worth and accept you.

i guess i just described the conflict of man vs society in literature.

there's also man vs nature, must be a majestic conflict, to view the majesty of the world.

and there's man vs man, a lot of times for stupid reasons. but when one person wants you dead, what is that?

i think i've grown up a lot this year. not in terms of intellect, but simply in understanding the angst of growing up, the pressure of simply surviving from one day to the next. simply in understanding the troubles people face everyday, being able to relate. the conflicts?

eyes, they connect people to the soul.

title: "intro cs reasons"

Learning happens very organically. Curriculum largely decides what you are supposed to learn but what you actually remember/learn differs from person to person.

When you learn more of a certain field, you get more perspective on why you
were introduced to subjects in certain ways. After a bit over two years, I feel
like I have this kind of perspective for some of my classes.

My programming languages class this semester has been very rewarding. I've been
exposed to lots of fundamental programming languages concepts that I now am surprised that I didn't really have a deep understanding of any of them.

We like to think programming languages are equivalent but then, I've learnt thatyour programming language controls the number of programs you can write. There are semantic choices to make when designing a language.

One of those fundamental semantic choices is scoping. Almost everyone believes
static scope is the better one. And surprisingly, python, being touted as one of the most user friendly languages,  has some really strange scoping rules. More comments about python [1][quora-python], [2][reddit-python]

This now leads to a realization of why many intro classes might prefer to teach
java. Java has a steeper learning curve but it's much more constrained so making it harder to develop bad habits. Since you can't have any code that isn't in a function, scope is explicit in Java. 

On the other hand, the learning curve for python is low but since it's both a scripting language, you can have code basically anywhere. This plus weird scoping rules can be confusing if you start on the wrong place.

There you go, the thing I realized about why intro classes like to teach Java.

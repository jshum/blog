I dislike reading about current events, usually ones concerning economics/politics. I feel like there's too much going on. People flip flop way too much and no one's views are consistent. It just feels like a very long season of Gossip Girl, with a whole lot of backstabbing and lies. But being slightly older now, I feel like that stubborn dislike should change. 

The first reason is that we need to be informed in order to make good decisions. 
Erikson's stage of psychosocial development is something I learnt in my developmental psychology class last year. In very general terms, it states that humans progress from being dependent to independence to being depended on. Part of that process involves learning how to live in a society, which actually is more difficult than we (or I) think. 
In college, our lives and actions are quite isolated from the real world. It's partially related to everything in college is very self contained. That sort of changes after college. We won't be living in an isolated world anymore. You *could* live in a barn in the Praries, but most of us choose to live in communities with other people, usually cities while we're young. Living in a society also means being exposed to and influenced by rules that can seem arbitrary and ridiculous. The way to learn how to react is by understanding how the system works. (The social sciences grew as a way of trying to identify these patterns, if there is actually a pattern in these seemingly incredibly complicated systems of humans interacting with each other.) 

I solemnly believe that 'Knowledge is Power'. The way I interpret that statement is that knowledge gives you understanding; understanding gives you the ability to see trends; seeing trends lets you predict. Prediction allows you to proactively prepare rather than passively react. Proactively preparing means you're more prepared and you're in a position to act differently, which is power.

I have an observation that I wonder if anyone else shares. How often does politics/economics enter your conversations? In a college setting at least, it does come up but usually revolves around a sensational topic. In dinner parties with other adults however, I feel like it comes up way more often, especially in large group settings with older people, politics always gets brought on.

I think one reason is quite simple. It's a simple topic that we know everyone will be at least partially educated about. 

I still feel though that adults talk about politics/economy issues to a much large degree than to the degree to which they really affect our lives. There's a lot more respect in the public sphere for experts in this area, the various news shows, the various celebrity analysts who have their own prime time show. Comparatively, there seems to be much less respect for a doctor/computer scientist per say, considering how much influence (I think) those topics have over our lives. 

In general, I think people over-exaggerate how much politics/economy will affect them. I also think people like using it as a platform for debate because who doesn't like arguing?

Hong Kong is interested in these topics because a lot of people are employed in these areas, which is directly affected by policy, economic climate. But I've realized that at least on this college campus, students are also surprisingly political. I know more than a few people who watch the Daily Show daily. 

I also have other conspiracy Machiavellian theories. Talking about politics/economy forces people to get to the core of their beliefs fairly quickly, allowing everyone else to know what kind of person they're dealing with. It sort of ties with this other idea of personal branding. It allows you show case very quickly, if you're honest, where you stand on the political spectrum. (In college, people start learning how to maintain their reputation, image. Overall, upperclassmen dress better, maybe has something to do with knowing how it's important to have an image.) There's also tying back to previously mentioned fact about reputation of those who understand politics. I feel like they get labelled 'smart' way more often than experts in other fields might. There are way more columnists commenting about politics/economics than there are about technology and science.

I don't want to be an expert on income policy tomorrow, or ever. But it's important to stay informed. In some ways is just knowing where your ideas are in some general ball park. A lot of these issues don't affect us. I think trying to have a view on anything is kind of silly until you are directly affected by it. 

_blog shortlist_

My main intention was to be informed so I sought out blogs that gave comprehensive overviews/analysis of current topics with low frequency instead of the high frequency news type blogs.

I used a couple sources for suggestions

##Health##

* It is a thing to get freshman flu. It is because there are a lot of people from every part of the world, so each person will bring some diseases from his/her part of the world, which your immune system has never had to deal with before. Compound this with lots of partying and trying out different ECA’s during the first few weeks where you will probably not be getting enough sleep. So you are likely to get very sick at some point during the fall semester. Don’t feel the pressure to try to live up to your high school crazy hours. Definitely rest a lot and email your professor to get extensions on stuff/homework. Professors are very understanding.
* The other thing is that you might get mono. It’s called the kissing disease but you can get it simply through drinking from the same cups as other people (which is unavoidable when you play beer pong) This is much harder to deal with. You get super tired and you want to sleep all the time. If you do get that, go to the doctor but they can’t do very much about it. Just listen to your body.
* Don’t abuse the ice cream machines in the dining halls. Look out for Freshman 15 and try to stay healthy.
* Every international freshman is required to take a tb screening test. And sometimes you test positive if you’re received the tb vaccine before, which I’m sure you have. If you do test positive, they will do a lung x-ray to make sure it’s not active. Even if it’s not active, they will often advise you to take some antibiotics for ONE WHOLE year, and they also tell you that you’re not supposed to drink alcohol while on this medication. Trust me, it’s pretty useless and if you do have to deal with this. I would recommend extremely against taking it.

##Partying/Substances##

###Alcohol###

* I remember freshman year weekends mostly being spent finding parties where they were serving alcohol. I think that that’s definitely part of the experience, and it also forces you to leave your dorm and go to parties where you will meet people. At the same time, I find that the common problem with lot of freshman is the tendency to binge drink when they find access to alcohol, because it is such a scarce resource . Obviously, you need to try, and until you’re sitting with your hands around the toilet bowl at 3am, you haven’t really experienced college. Having said that, you have me here, and you should obviously tell me if you need some alochol for you and your friends so that you don’t have to binge drink.
* If you are willing to dedicate a Brita pitcher and filter solely to alcohol, filtering cheap vodka through these things 3-5 times makes it so much better.
* Your RA will not care if you are drinking or partying in your dorm room AS LONG as you aren’t keeping them up, or anyone who likes to complain up. You can also hold parties in common spaces in dorms if you so desire, as long as nobody complains.
Drugs 


###Drugs###

* I think you should have heard a thing or two now about Brown’s drug culture. I think it’s a true statement that a lot of students do experiment with drugs when they go to Brown. 
* I think there are two things to bear in mind: 1, America’s acceptance towards drugs is MUCH MUCH higher than in East Asia; 2, drugs (especially marijuana) have an equally important status as alcohol/cigarettes in American culture. So you shouldn’t be surprised that a lot of your friends have tried marijuana. With that said, I think it’s incorrect to label these people as druggies or stupid. In fact, the aftereffects of marijuana are actually more mild than alcohol. (A hangover is way worse than anything you can get with weed, where you only get tired the next day instead of feeling tired AND nauseous) 
* In general, Americans have a much more receptive/open culture towards drugs, even just compared to a few years ago. For example, Rhode Island recently de-criminalized marijuana in quantities less than an ounce. I think it’s mostly a realization that people on marijuana aren’t harmful (except driving motor vehicles) and that it’s impossible to get addicted to marijuana, which avoids the societal costs like heroin addicts.
* Basically, I’m saying marijuana is a lot more common place in american than you are probably used to. I’m not saying you have to try it, nor am I saying you shouldn’t. That’s something you should decide for yourself, but I’d just like to provide more of the cultural context for you because it’s something that I have slowly come to understand. 

##Social##

###Hallway###

* I personally think it’s super important to develop a good relationship with your hallway or some hallway if you can. This will serve as your first group of your friends and through them, you will also be able to meet lots of different people.
* Don't try too hard to make the ‘right group’ of friends. You’ll come to realize that in comparison to high school, college lets you see a very small portion of people every day-- especially during a week day. So it is much easier to develop a deep relationship with people who are physically close to you. (having said that, you don’t have to force it. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t)
* And then stick with them. Hapiness/emotional fulfillment is positively correlated to the quality and not the quantity of friendship
* Go to the events that RAs in your dorm will invariably throw for you, and if they’re kinda lame ask if the slightly interesting dude or chick is hungry and skip out for an eatery. 

###ECAs###

* I strongly suggest that you to find an activity which you like doing, and especially recommend groups that are competitive or have to perform. Because these kinds of groups a lot better for bonding than minimal-commitment clubs where you only need to organize an event, which is just admin work. Also, a lot more important is that you like the people in that group. Obviously, that’s hard to figure out on your first meeting, but it’s not that hard to figure out. Just imagine yourself in the yearbook picture. Would you like to be part of this group? There's obviously a lot of variety even within the same category of groups. There are community work clubs which are minor commitment-- you will have more interaction with the recipient of the service than your fellow college students.
* Definitely go to the Activities fair at the OMAC. Take fliers so you remember what you were kinda interested in doing. Go to as many meetings of clubs as you can possibly manage. Grab a new friend to check it out, it’s great friendship fodder. Additionally, clubs like to entice new members to come to meetings with free food. If they are giving out Meeting Street Cookies, just go. Please.

Some examples:

* Arts: Acapella, Impulse (hip-hop dance) , Badmaash (Indian-style dance), Improv comedy, orchestra, ballroom dance, Salsa, Taiko
* Sports : club volleyball, soccer, basketball, Taekwondo, ultimate
* Community : globemed/medlife (mobile clinics in developing nations), BRYTE (refugee tutoring), algebra in motion/science  mentoring, college counseling (lots of education related opportunities with Hope High School), SPACE (arts mentoring at correctional facilities in Rhode Island), MED International (improving healthcare infrastructure in developing countries)
* Academic : FSAE, IEEE, various DUGS,

###Relationships###

* In general, it’s hard to date, but Brown is a great place to meet people. You don’t have to meet people with only dating in mind. Just spend time with people you like hanging out with and like talking to. It’s actually probably better to not date right from the get-go, as you miss out on getting to know a lot of other people.


###Culture###
* You will find that it is very much a thing for people to watch TV shows together in the states, which I find kind of weird. But do it. You probably won’t understand south park humor when you watch it for the first time but you should definitely still watch it because that week’s episode of south park, archer, and it’s always sunny often becomes the topic of conversation.

##Brown Specific##

###TIPS###

* DON’T GET A LANYARD. If one is forced upon you, DON’T WEAR YOUR LANYARD. It will scream “freshman”. Unless if that’s what you’re going for, in which case wear it loud and proud.
* Asking for numbers is zero percent creepy the first few weeks, and gets exponentially more difficult to do as time progresses and friend groups form. If you’ve had a decent conversation, feel free to go for it. Ask them to do things-- yo, wanna check out ____ together? hey, let’s see [insert event that is going on]. 
* Go to all of the orientation events. ALL OF THEM. Okay. Maybe not the financial literacy workshops.
* Supercuts isn’t too expensive. It’s about 15 bucks for a haircut, which is the cheapest you’re going to find. Unless you want to get a buzz cut like I did, you can get those at Ed’s for 10 dollars. 
* Get a futon for your room in freshman year
* Don’t get laundry service. Doing your own laundry A) takes less time, and B) cheaper
* Organize secret santa for your hallway if nobody does. Use Facebook and make events. Be THAT dude, the one who makes things happen. People will appreciate you a lot for it because they’re lazy turds who want to meet people and do things, but don’t like to organize
* There’s kabob and curry and shanghai at blue room every night. You can use your credits at blue room after 4:30/5 every day 
* Traditional study spots : SciLi, The rock, 
* Good study spots where it’s quiet if you don’t want to study in the library : Wilson hall at night, JWW if you get there early to claim a spot, B&H at night, 
* The first nice days of Spring. Spend them outdoors throwing frisbees, or footballs unless you have a midterm/paper/project due the next day.
* Hop on a rooftop at Brown, they’re pretty fun. Andrews and TWC are open via fire escape. I think Faunce recently began to lock its doors.
* Shop a lot of courses. Take at least one class which is small. First Year Seminars are designed specifically to give freshmen that experience, take advantage of it

###Brown traditions###

* Go to waterfire
* Go to Spring weekend
* Go to SPG as a freshman if you don’t have a girlfriend, or else it will be super awkward
* Go to the organ concert on Halloween night and the night before the first exam.
* Go see the naked donut run
* Go to a couple frat parties as a freshman at least
* Dress up for halloween

##Food##

There are four general areas for good food. In order of distance:

###Thayer street (within 5 min of campus)###

* Spice : Thai food, kind of crude but big portions ($10-15).
* Haruki express : passable japanese food,not comparable to Hong Kong quality of course ($10-20) 
* East side pockets, great middle eastern pockets (fallafels are some of the best I’ve had) ($7-8 per wrap and pretty full).  
* Chipotle (Mexican-american food : Burritos and Rice bowls) ($7-8, burritos is about 300-500 calories more than just rice bowl, decently full after rice bowl) 
* Paragon (american), Andreas (Greek). they’re ok but a little pricer ($15-30)
* Meeting street cafe - super awesome sandwiches and subs and gigantic portions. ($10-15)
* SHANGHAI - never go there. NEVER
* Soban - great korean food. bimbimbap and tofu stew. ($10-15)
* Baja (Mexican-american, about same price as Chipotle but ingredients aren’t as fresh. but large portions, also about $7-8). Unlimited toppings, yo
* Kabob and curry : really good indian food ($10-15)
* Pizza (Antonoios and Nice slice)
* The Creperie-- savory crepes and dessert crepes. Their smoothies are also pretty good
* Gourmet Heaven (they just opened. They have a buffet and you pay by weight. There are also a ton of sandwiches you can order as well. Pretty good but buffet can be pricey if you aren’t careful) ($7-15)
* Tealuxe-- if you are oddly hankering for bubble tea, theirs is much much better than Sushi Express. Though more pricy.

###Brook/Hope (5-10 mins from campus)###

* Ironwok is northern style chinese food so more spicy, (mongolian beef is good. soups are terrible, dumplings are the frozen kind not fresh) (~$13-15 per meal but you’ll be very full). 
* Louie’s ($7-15) : great breakfast food
* Wings and things : great chicken wings for Superbowl games and also parmesan chicken is good. ($10-15)
* Angkor (Hope) : Thai food, BYOB. Very small so may be cramped on weekends. ($10-15)

###Wickenden (10-15 minute walk south of campus)###

* Sakura Tokyo : Japanese food, BYOB. Better than Haruki express IMO
* Tastes of India : Pretty good ($15-20?)
* Brickway on Wickenden and a couple other breakfast places (All super good) ($8-15)
* Ethiopian food
* Duck and Bunny (dericious cupcakes but also serves dinner but petite sizes)
* Around Ives St, 15-20 minute walk from South side of campus
* Noodles 101, $10-15. Customizable noodles, Asian fusion kind of feel. Pretty cute.

###Downtown (20-30 minutes West of campus)###

* Mill’s Tavern, New Rivers $$$ but very good
* Harry’s Burger Bar-- every weekday 3-5pm, half off burgers and beer! They have good burgers. You may not partake in their beer. It’s on North Main St, about 10-15 minutes away.
* Geoffs Superlative Sandwiches-- buy one get one free sandwich deal every Tuesday. Free pickles galore, if you adore pickles. Their sandwiches are great. It’s about a 10 minute walk from the Pembroke campus, towards South Main Street and along Meeting St.

###Wayland Square (west side of Waterman St, ~10 minute walk from SciLi)###

* Haruki East- the better half of Haruki Express. Pretty good, still around $10-15

###FOOD TRUCKS###
* Mama Kims
* Lotus Pepper
* Plouf plouf

###Federal Hill-- take the RIPTA Trolley 92, it says FEDERAL HILL in giant letters. It’s about a 10 minute drive there. You can tell when you have arrived because everything gets super adorable.###

* Pastiche has ridiculously good, albeit expensive, desserts
* Mumu Cuisine allegedly has the best Chinese food in Providence. 
* Providence Oyster Bar has happy hour every week day from 4-6:30pm. Oysters are $1, and all entrees are $6. $6!!!!!!! Don’t bring too many friends, because you have to sit in the bar area and there are only so many seats there.

###Hope Street/Blackstone Boulevard. (Hard to get to unless you drive/ride a bike)###

* Chez Pascal $$$, nom nom nom
* India
* Apsara

##International Specific##

* Get a social security card first. Before you apply for anything in USA. It makes life so much easier.
* There are only ATMs for three banks on campus : BoA, Citizen, Sovereign. Strongly recommend BoA after three years with Citizen. Citizen is just too small of a bank and has zero presence outside of the Northeast.
* Tmobile has cheapest individual plans, but some people say have the worst service. It’s been fine in Rhode Island, a lot worse in San Francisco.
* Google voice is pretty cheap and convenient to call home with. Mom seems to have a problem with it but you’re really just calling a local phone number so I don’t know why she’s pissed about the signal. 
* I know that you can get a USA license using your Hong Kong license. But that’s only after you get an international license which is when you get your full license, meaning a year after you pass your exams.
* So, I would recommend you to also get your Rhode Island driver license because it is A) a form of identification that most places (including domestic flights) accept, which is a lot better than carrying your passport around and being afraid of losing it. 
* Also Zipcar requires that you have your license for a year before you can apply for a membership. I’m trying to see if I can use my Hong Kong license. Anyway, it’s just easier to have a USA driver’s license. 
* Also, I’ve found that people are less racist and treat me like an american when I present my driver’s license for identification purposes.
* Summer storage is usually one of the other more annoying things that have to be dealt with. Paying for storage sucks and they sometimes lose your shit. I recommend finding a friend who is subletting over the summer and storing your stuff in their basement.

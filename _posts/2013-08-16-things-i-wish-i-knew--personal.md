_Q: how do you construct your social life?_

*Advice* : Stick around your freshman hall in freshman year. Make friends in class and in activities. Learn how to be a good friend and a good coversationalist. 

In the same way freshman want to do well in academics, some freshman wanted to do well socially. No one wants to admit they were nerds in high school so a lot of people were trying hard to change themselves. I think a lot of people try but there's a couple of things to keep in mind. It's hard to be truthful and honest if you're pretending to be someone else. And as a good friend of mine pointed out to me, 'you haven't changed a bit. you're exactly the same'. They're probably right. 

Most colleges mandate that freshman live in freshman dorms in doubles, because it's the most conducive environment for friendships. I lived about 30 steps from 20 people and we all hung out together almost every night. I think that's important. I think this group of friends will be your first group of long-lasting friendships. 

Having said that, never stop making new friends. The classes you take and the activities you do to a large degree determine who your friends will be over the next three years will be. It's more important to find a group of friends you're comfortable with, because friends are not only for having fun but also for bearing the burden with you. 

Once you leave the setting of large freshman hall groups and move into doubles or suites as an upperclassman, you will no longer have this type of large group interaction on a daily basis. Therefore, it becomes paramount that you learn how to maintain these relationships. Usually, it's either a weekday lunch/dinner or a weekend hangout together scenario. 

And being a good friend is something you need to think about as well. An idea that sticks with me is survivor bias. Anyone who reaches the top level, and in this case, academics, is sufficiently self-motivated, selfish and confident and maybe even bordering on egotistical in their abilities. Adding to that is the idea that we only ever know what we are thinking, not how other people think. To become a good friend, you therefore have to go against these two instincts you have. Listen, observe, understand. The idea is simple, just try to get past the barrier that separates you and the other person. Remind yourself that everyone has something to teach and something interesting to say. It can't be emphasized enough how much you can learn about someone by observation. But be sure not to speculate.

In fact, when you're having a 1-on-1 conversation with other people. Just know that everyone is trying to say something. Everyone has something on their mind. You just have to find the opportunity/window for them to say it, which is why being a good conversationalist is a skill. Learn how to ask good questions.

[Deep relationships are the key to happiness][1]. Meeting, growing deep bonds with even a handful of people will be the greatest thing you would have ever done.

_Q : What should we expect to happen to us in college?_

*Advice* Obviously, you shouldn't have any preconceived notion of who you should become. I think be prepared to be a worse version of yourself. By that I mean, if you did everything perfectly up until this point, be prepared to make lots of mistakes. And rejoice in mistakes, it's the only sure-fire way of knowing that what you did is wrong. Be prepared to grow, incorporate a lot more view points and different experiences.

Growth is separated into the personal and social component. Roughly, I like to think of your personal side as the values you hold, and your social side as the way you present your views to the rest of the world, and how you interact with other people. 

There's opportunities for both in college. For personal growth, I think the college experience will be very challenging in itself. You have to figure out your place in society. It's important to reflect during these four years, think about the past you didn't choose, how to come to terms with it, and what you want for your future.

It depends on your college as well. Some liberal arts colleges in cold far away places are more conducive to reading and reflection, while others are a lot more about the social experience. Hopefully, you chose the one right for you, but there's something to learn and acknowledge in any setting. 

But college is less of a philosophical place than it was in the past. It's not a place where we should just hide away reading books. Obama has been a prodigious reader since attending Occidental College in California where he said he read "tons of books". It's very much about the social aspect as well. We grow through our interactions with other people, learn about their points of views. 

_Q : What are some important questions to ask yourself?_

What is your relationship with time? Do you feel like you are always looking forward to something else rather than enjoying the present moment.

I think humans have a long struggle with time. Time is weird. Good things in the future seem incredibly far away but bad things in the future seem incredibly close. 

I think it's a bad idea to have to 'get anything done with'. Because every second spent is another second wasted. Surely, we don't live in a world where we can decide what we want to do all the time but we do. 

Learning how to live in the moment through the good and bad parts is something incredibly difficult but necessary to think through

_Q : What is the menatlity to have in college?_

Everyone has some sort of an existential crisis in their life. There may be that one day where you feel that you're worthless and life is meaningless. You will fall off your pedastal and end up in the gutter. It will be, pardon my language, pretty s**** feeling but this part determines how much grit you have. It's up to you to decide how to crawl out of it. It's a combination of lowering your standards and trying harder.

The key revelation is realizing that you control you life. I've talked a lot about this so I'm not going to rehash. But go here for more ideas.

One thing that I've picked up is the positive-incrementalist mentality that is indicative of communities like Quora. I believe in a highly proactive way of living, improving yourself. There are a lot of things that are within your power that you can do to change your life. The keys to being a better person is to start with the small things. Start with the way you dress. One thing that is different between freshman and upperclass man is that upperclassmen are in general more well dressed. Look good for yourself.

I think having the right attitude in college is a lot more important than anything else. Being open to everything is important
I felt like I've been trying to move in a certain direction for most my three years here. And now that I've finally reached some kind of finishing line, it feels kind of awful because I don't actually know how I reached here. I feel like I gave up a number of things to be here. But at the same time, I'm not going to complain about the perks that I get because I am here now.

_Q : What is America?_

A large part of my struggle was getting to understand and assimilate into America. There's a couple of truths to American that I want to mention.

Comedy is a very important part of popular culture. If you want to know how well you understand America, watch an episode of South Park and see how much of it you understand. A lot of comedy is social satire so if you can pick up on the satirical references hidden in comedy, this means you understand the culture fairly well. 

There are comedies which are much more indirect, Louie, is a lot more based on characters. Louie gives you a sense of what it means to live as middle class in a big city in the modern day. Humor is contextual. 

America still sees race to a large degree, worst in the south, mediocre in the east and lot better in the west. Race is by and far still a large part of our lives, as are outward appearances. It sucks for those it works against but is great for those who thrive with it.

title: "how to learn"
---

Even though I've been in college for two years, I'm still learning how to learn.

Let me first talk about why you should read everything I saw with some skepticism, then I will write out what I want to say.

When you're learning something, you're always engaging yourself in a form of reflection, of reviewing your
behavior, picking it apart and critiquing it.

This is why quarterbacks watch a lot of tape. This is why students are often told to review their problem sets. But when you learn to learn, you aren't focused on just one instance of you learning a skill. You're trying to generalize over many instances of your approach to learning. Furthermore, it is difficult to remove yourself one step even further. It's hard enough to remove yourself to reflect your skill. It's very difficult to remove yourself to reflect on the way you're 'reflecting on your skill'.

We have intuitions. But current research and logic tells us that our intuitions are downright awful. In fact, one could say the whole point of academic learning at least, is to remove our intuition. (On the other hand, if you're an athelete or engaged in some types of craft, there's a lot of research about the state of flow you need to be in. You're not thinking through your actions when you're playing tennis or playing the cello. You're just relying on your muscle memory.)

So what I am going to say perhaps applies only to academic learning. People with more experience in other fields should feel free to support or deny this claim. 

The other thing to bear in mind is that each time you learn something, it's an experiment. The subject has changed but that has a log of implications. Perhaps you have very little background knowledge in this area. Perhaps you really want to learn it well. Perhaps you have particularly little intuition for this area. Perhaps it's a very jargon, notation heavy topic. Perhaps there's a very key piece of understanding that you got caught up on and made everything afterwards seem very difficult. In each of these instances, you don't really know how this particular topic will affect your learning experience until you actually learn it. Which means every single instance is seemingly independent.

So how to learn?

Learning, in the college setting at least, usually follows this pattern. You're taking three to five classes. You either have reading or problem sets. (My experiences are mostly in pset classes. My general learning experience in reading-intensive classes has been underwhelming)

From what I can tell about college professors, most of them assign homework because it's pedagogical. 
All professors find grading homework and an extremely time-consuming and pointless chores. The value in doing homework is for the students. 

Thus, the homework must be worth it if the professor assigns it even though he doesn't want to grade it.

There's two caveats to this. There are professors who like toturing students and the graders. If you find some homework actually repetitive, don't do it. This should not be mistaken for homework problems that are really long and require a lot of manual computation like doing decompositions for linear algebra. In those, you are really learning a particular algorithm. If the point is just learning the algorithm, you probably should skip it, but sometimes you do gain a bit of insight into the process by doing lots of examples of it.

So the general strategy to doing psets is that you want to start early. 
You want to try to struggle through it by yourself. You want all of those a-ha moments to happen in your brain. I spent most of the past two years trying to collaborate with other people on homework. What I tend to find those is that when you collaborate with others, the learning experience decreases for the person who has done the lesser amount of work when two people meet.

The benefits of doing homework in groups is that you tend to do much better on average. The downsides of doing psets by yourself is that they take way longer (and at least in my case do worse). But when your homework is returned, you should understand every single point that the grader makes.

Learning is all about resource management. Time is always running out. You never have enough time so you have to meticulously be balancing time and what you want to do.
If you want to be a solo adventurer on an academic conquest, your life will be completely consumed by psets.
You'll have very little time to be doing anything else because your brain will always be occupied and frustrated by how to solve different problems.

If you rather enjoy your time at college, have time for social activities, don't mind cramming before colleges, then doing psets in groups allows to finish it in the shortest amount of time.

Again, it's a life style choice. I'm coming from a point of view of a person who dedicates probably most of his waking hours during the school year to school work, and very little for extra-curriculars. That is all.

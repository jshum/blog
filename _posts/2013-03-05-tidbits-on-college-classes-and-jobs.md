title: "tidbits on college, classes and jobs"
tldr: "college is more about coping with irregularities and having a job is about regularizing for efficiency. my four classes in spring 2013 and good software engineering analogies."

### college vs job ###
My first thought is about the different mentalities required for going to college and having a job. 

Things are always happening in college because you have a bunch of people who have endless amounts of energy and ideas and you could argue a lot of time on their hands. There's very little cost to do most things because you have cheap labor, lots of support from the university and nothing to lose. It's easy to end up doing a lot and feel a little bit swamped. **College is about surviving.**  

When you get a job, your life is a lot more regular. 9 to 5. You can have a life after work. You have time to pick up a hobby. Given this regularity, you have a lot more opportunities to regulate your life to maximize your efficiency/productivity.

I know a lot of people who try to regulate their lives in college, only sleep this amount, only work this amount. I'm not saying it's impossible but in general it's fairly difficult because your workload is likely to vary drastically from week to week. 

### classes ###
1. CS157: Algorithms. The course aims to teach programmers a general approach on how to approach computational problems. i.e. if someone asks you to write code to sort a list of numbers. what are the different ways of doing it and how do they compare in speed, efficiency?
2. CS195F: Machine Learning which is using computers to do statistics. For example: creating a machine that recognizes different coins. You have a large set of data points that come in pairs (diameter and weight). Since the same type of coin will have a similar diameter and weight, they will cluster together on a scatter plot, to look like something like this -> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Cluster-2.svg. So you can take advantage of to partition the different clusters. The class teaches different ways of doing this, the different measures of 'closeness' that can be used for minimization/maximization.
3. My third  class is going to be a graduate level statistics class in the public health department. It's nice because it's aimed for biostats students who have less of a math background. So they're going to try to teach the intuition instead of going into too much of the mathy details.
4. The class I'm being a teaching assistant for is: Probabilistic Models in Computer Science. You can think of it as applying probability to computer science problems. We can often trade off accuracy for speed, but the downside is that there is a possible chance that an algorithm might fail. Therefore, we can do some analysis on what happens in the general case. It's really like thinking about investments. It could be very bad or it could be very good. But in the general case, I should expect certain things to happen. 

### software engineering ###

What is software engineering, this dark art which I always feel like I'm not good enough at?

My addition
> You will adding little patches to the bridge every week probably. 

> Furthermore, you're also very likely going to build another improved version of budge on top of that bridge while it is being used, but now able to accomodate sixteen wheelers and have automatic toll booths, make an instant transition to the new bridge over night.

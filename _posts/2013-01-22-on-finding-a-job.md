### campus jobs ###
Have a midterm on Thursday but can't really think about it as there are a bunch of other things happening. Internship finding, HTA applications.  
From a credible source, it seems to be that I missed out on the position that I've wanted for so long because I had missed my interview and didn't follow up. It pains me to no end that I did something so stupid like this. It's also completely my fault.

There's two things that are keeping me sane. The first is that it would be a big time commitment and I would be extremely busy recruiting and applying for a job in the fall anyway. It would be relatively difficult to balance 10-12 hours of work a week and trying to take hard classes, flying off every other weekend to interview and a girlfriend I'm so desperately trying to look for. In that regard, this is a good thing. Time is more precious than anything else. We only have time and sweat to give, and you can't even give sweat if you don't have time. Perhaps it's a sign that I should look at giving time to something/somebody else. 

The second thing it's probably better saved for people who want to go into grad school. I don't necessarily need that formal of an algorithmic training to do well in industry. These two things are keeping me sane.

But yes, Wil makes a good point. 'Remember how shitty you feel after missing an interview and make sure you don't do it again.'

### real jobs ###
Yea, this part is annoying. I'll write an actual post in the future about the little lessons I've learn about internship/job finding later.

Pieces of advice from a business guy
* politely-aggresive
* it's all about what happens after they say no. giving suggestions of what you can do shows that you are taking initiative
* don't let the low level people block you. override them and go to the top. (in some senses, fake it till you make it)

Pieces of advice from my mom
* don't be naive, it was never about how good you were. It's always been about who you know.

And you know, I take all of this advice to heart but part of me goes back to a conversation I had with Jim and Goops last night while we were laughing about what kind of f***** up shit we would try to make people do if we were rich and powerful. As I should often remember, the rest of the world isn't like the Ivy Leagues. It's a completely different mentality here. Everyone was brought up by a very specific breed of parents who yell at you because you didn't email that one contact at a company and insensitively compare you to someone who has done far less work. Everyone here is social climbing, doing the right things and meeting the right people, making the right move, playing the right card. (analogy overload I know) But not everyone is like me or you.

There's a whole other world there. People who don't rush to go somewhere to be someone before they reach a certain age. A lot of people who live a month, a year at a time. (Although, I personally believe that you should try to think as far ahead as you can, though only as far as you can without feeling stressed. Although planning is really the only way to de-stress. In some way, you could say the only real pressure of living is money in most capitalistic worlds. Once money is out of the equation, there isn't any real stress.)

Knowledge is free. Really, it's completely free. There's something to discover about the world everyday. 

But power and wealth aren't free. They cost you time, time and breath to suck up to the people who are currently in those positions, your conscience if you go against one of your principles to get there. Parts of you erode as you ascent, your vision more and more narrow as you surge. None of that can be returned to you when you reach that position.

### boyfriend job ###
I also want a job as a boyfriend. I qualify but most of the responses I've gotten are either we're not offering this job in your current location, or we're not ready to take any new hires right now. 

### real real job ###
What is your real real job as a human being? Your real job is only to feed you, but your real real job concerns your spiritual/mental growth. The fruit of that labor is your soul. Maintaining that takes a lot longer and its effects not as obvious. But that eventually occurs.

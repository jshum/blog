got this from someone taking the class right now.

* synthesis chemistry is hard simply because of the volume of knowledge you need to remember. there's a lot of exceptions and corner cases that you have to remember.
* especially difficult is stereochemistry where you have to visualize the resulting chiral molecules in 3D.
* the difficulty lies in not really have any intuition to guide you
* with math, you have a general idea of what the proof, solution looks like. half of math is simply trying build that intuition.
* orgo is hard because it's very specific subject matter and there's no real intuition unless you already know it very well. obviously, no undergrad who takes the classs will have that intuition.
* for 6,7 step synthsis, you have really have very little idea of what the intermediate chemicals are. furthermore, you have to take into account all these exceptions to make sure all the steps you're taking are valid.

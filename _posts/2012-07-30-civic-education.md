title: "civic education"
tldr: "civic education was met with strong resistance when it was suggested in july 2012. I wrote this at the time voicing my slight disapproval of the resistance. You could label me as pro-china."

it's sort of sad to see all the debate on the guo min jiao yu, all the backlash towards the chinese government

it's probably because i'm not in hk listening to to the complete story and i come from a biased point of view.
i think a lot of the anger is misguided.

[let's talk objectively.][0]

it is true that they promised 50 years of no change. but what kind of change does guo min jiao yu actually constitute? 
civic education is hardly a new course that young people throughout the world have been taking. obviously, it's about fostering patriotism.
and it does seem to me that hong kong does belong to china, and we are ethnically chinese, although many of us are clear to make the distinction.
maybe it's symbolic change. the change that once we get pass will be used as a precedent. the day the tide of the war changed.

on another level, think of the number of times you get to cheer for hong kong.
when you aren't in hong kong, what are the chances you get to cheer for hong kong. hong kong is a well known city but when are their opportunities to cheer for hong kong.

and it makes sense for the chinese government to try to instill a sense of identity right? after all, hong kong belongs to china. and nobody wants a rouge city, right?
and if we believe that this civic education will brainwash us, and reduce our critical thinking, i think it is obvious that we acknowledge that hong kong people then have very little critical thinking
i just need to point to norway after the shooting last year. the norwegian prime minsters asked the people to respond to the shooting with more love, more democracy and more freedom.
"The bombs and bullets were intended to change Norway. The Norwegian people responded by reasserting our values," Stoltenberg said. "The perpetrator failed to achieve what he set out to do. The people triumphed."
and perhaps, that would be a better approach for us. to respond to this with more open-mindedness.

to think of it from another perspective. everyone earns their place in history.
if you don't mind me asking, what has hong kong contributed to china?
if we deserve a place in the history books, we will. but first we need to work for that place. if we want others to recognize us, we first need them to be proud of us.

i do agree with we need representation and we need rights.
but think from the standpoint of a chinese leader for a moment. hong kong has seen more economic prosperity and civil freedom in the last 15 years than it has ever seen. let me remind you that the british CHOSE all of our governors.
we've spent the last 15 years bickering about our rights and our non-existent freedoms when the truth is a bit far from the story.

i shouldn't compare but i always look at singapore when i think about hong kong. both city-states. singapore also has to worry about foreign policy and self defence. they don't have the backing of china. yet, they've done so well for themselves. one of the best education systems in the world. Singapore has a staggering number of high tech companies working in semiconductors and biotech. Hong Kong carved their niche as the gateway to China but Singapore carved their niche as the gateway to Asia-Pacific. And that door to China is growing larger and larger.

Think of China as the Forbidden city and Hong Kong is the fee collector of the only little door open on the front wall. But the main gates are opening to the forbidden city are slowly opening. 

thoughts from Jan 2013:
ideology should never be forced down anyone's throats. and yes from reading more, civic education does seem to be doing that. if it had been more mild, basically a history class, i probably would have supported it.   
But I do feel the need for hong kong people to be exposed to more things happening in China. It's not about brain washing, it's simply being more informed about what is happening. I think too much of the news on China and the way it is presented in Hong Kong media really unfairly portrays China, especially its government. Hong Kong journalists like to imagine us the holder or truth, while the Chinese government censor and massacre. I think trying to understand what is going on will  give us a more fair-valued judgement of the progress they have made in the past three decades.   
see, Hong Kong's in a bad place.   
People in Hong Kong want autonomy, but China doesn't want to relish control.   
The lack of freedom has forced many to feel the need to go radical. Perhaps if they had givenus autonomous control to begin with, we would have become a lot less rogue. Revolutionaries arise only because the opportunity calls for it.
The result is even stronger confrontations. Hong Kong as a whole is very mild. Most professionals I've met have very open opinions about alot of things but there are some outspoken individuals in society who claim to represent my opinon as well.

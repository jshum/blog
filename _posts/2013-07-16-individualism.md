Western civilization has a preoccupation with individualism. Straight from the Declaration of Independence,

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

I have never really understood it what it meant to be western versus chinese, especially among American Born Chinese. But I can still identify those who are Chinese and those who are American. 

People like to use the words sacrificial when they write short stories about their grandparents or parents, their hardworking first generation immigrant families. But that word can not really be applied to our generation anymore. Yet, I can still sense it, differentiate the American-Chinese and the Chinese-American. 

But I think I can put a finger on it now. This is only a guess. I think the Chinese mentality is the one that foregoes a little bit of that individual liberty in exchange for something in the future, whether it material comfort, harmony, stability in the future.

Think high saving rates, think low divorce rates, think high average incomes, think heavy emphasis on education. A little less me and a little more we.

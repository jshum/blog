My friend baodegushi [wrote a post][1] that inspired me to write out some thoughts that have been on my mind for a little while. 

In the first part of his post, he argues about the career-driven mentality, philosphy that a lot of people have. The main points are
* people value money over everything else using the janitor, ibanker example
* people who define success by their job.
* people who derive happiness/satisfication from having more money than others. 

Baodgegushi, I've met too many people of this kind in my life, unfortunately a lot of whom go into ibanking. The second part is his definition of meaningfulness which I will come back to in a future post.

My views are a little more moderate.

I think of life as a linear progression, at least the way society expects us to live it out is structured according to the anthropological lessons we've learned in the last 500 years is that as a human goes from dependence to independence to becoming a provider
Education, that occurs in between the stages of dependence and independence, is what society sees as being necessary to learn to become a productive member of society A simple way to measure how far our civilization has progressed is to simply count the numer of years of education each child required to go through. If we were an agricultural society, one would become a productive member as soon as you could work a shovel/pick and that would occur simply by physical development. Therefore, families had lots of offspring since the cost of raising a child was low.

In today's quartenary society, this is no longer true. New members of society have to go through years of education. As the tasks we need to perform become more complicated,,
specialization is needed. In some senses, your point of how we're always preparing for the next thing ties with this. To prepare ourselves better for the tasks of tomorrow, there is a need to learn more than people in the past did. This is where technical school differs from a college. Technical school teaches practical things like knowing how to operate specific types of machinery etc, while colleges try to teach the abstraction/generalizztion. For a lot of knowledge at least, it starts with very specific examples before they are generalized to more abstract terms. we don't learn accounting or groccery store arithmetic, we learn math.

But what does a job mean in our long lives? The start of that part of our lives looms close. That is the next part of our lives as foretold by every single commencement speaker. Therefore, it is really important what you end up doing. Assuming we're awake 15 hours a day, that's 40/105, 40% of our daily lives. Assuming we work from 22 til 60, that's almost 40 years, which is like half our lives if we're optimisitc, and 2/3 if your'e not. (Mind you that retirement age is increasing)

You have to realize you will spend a lot of time in your life working. Spending a lot of time doing the thing you're being paid to do, and probably getting pretty good at it. Once you get in the whole process of looking for internships and jobs, you realize jobs come from being paid to do something someone else doesn't want to do.  
There's mcjobs and good jobs:  
McJobs : janitors, office administrators, jobs where you don't learn a lot and can be easily replaced  
Good jobs : jobs where you get paid to learn new skills. These can occur in any industry but are more difficult to get.   
[Here's a very interesting analysis][2] using simple math on how you can think of good jobs. 
The point of education is to prepare for the good jobs so that you don't end up in a dead end job.  Nothing is worse than your effort and energy and your money to get to a job where you are pushing papers your whole life. As my friend [mbwong][2] put it, optimize how your time is spent in your life.

Something else to think of and that is the kinds of jobs that will still actually be there in [forty years][4]. Most new jobs are in technology. My prediction is that all the jobs in the future will require programming. More and more jobs will also be [free-lancing jobs][3] that will mentally exhuasting, won't really teach you anything at all but pay very little.

Regarding mortal's obsession with money, here's what I have to say:
* Money is a double edged sword. You can't think of it in black and white terms.
* [Wealth removes constraints. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing depends on the extent to which you needed those constraints.][quora]
*  Also, young people don't know what they are doing. we're just blindly following something we decided or what someone else told us not knowing what's really happening out there. It's hard to resist money when it's given to you. It makes you feel you're worth something. It makes you feel powerful because you're financially independent. But what we don't understand is that they've now controlled us with money.

>if the world is destined to become meaningless, i feel that my goal in life is to preserve and create meanings in the world for as long as i live, no matter how insignificant it is in the grand scheme of things. it is like taking pictures of fireworks: it is a proof that, despite the fact that the sky is going to be pitch dark again after the show, it brightened the sky with sparkling colors for a few secondsâ€¦ it is the proof of a temporal meaningful existence in an eternal meaningless world.

Part of Series [Things I wish I knew before College][college]

####Freshman####

Lessons learned : lower expectations, how to find your place in life. 

I was top 10% of my class when I graduated from high school, granted my graduating class was about 80 people large. I was pretty full of myself then. I remember asking Jun Hou what kind of math I should study during the summer and he replied epsilon delta proofs. It is only about half a year ago that I found out what branch of mathematics those things are even part of. Moral of the story, Jun Hou is insanely smart.

For some reason I believed I was destined for great things in college. I imagined that I was going to be the superstar on campus, excelling at everything I did, pretty much like high school I suppose.  I was very concerned about my impact on Brown. I wanted to be the student that would be remembered for a very long time. I think that's true for most high school graduates especially at a place like Brown. Everyone was a valedictorian and had taken dozens of AP classes. Everyone thought they were going to be the big fish in this small pond. So I tried everything I could put my hands onto : Engineering, CS, Math, Comparative Literature, Music, FSAE. Till this day, I don't know how I managed to do all of that in Freshman year.

I think you know where this is going. I had a little of a existential crisis that spring. I think it was one of those weekdays that I was all alone in the engineering shop making the intake. I had volunteered to make a part because I wanted to prove that I was one of the more capable freshman who knew how to machine. It was about 3am at this point. I was on the last step of the process. I had taken a little bit of a risky shortcut. And then s**** just exploded. The part was broken and all my last 14 hours of work had just been absolutely for nothing. 

All existential crisis are the same. It's the moment where you feel that you're worthless and life is meaningless. It feels like you fell off from from a building and ended up in the gutter and there's dirty rain water being splashed by cars coming by. 

It was, pardon my language, a pretty s**** feeling. I think that was actually the week before Spring Break. I didn't go back to the shop that much after that night. My participation slowly died down over the rest of the semester. 

Classes were also harder than I had expected. I was no longer interested in the comparative literature that I had excitedly signed up for at the beginning of the semester anymore. A lot of my classes turned out a lot worse than I had hoped. None of my professors were that great at lecturing that material at all, except Bower. 

[Socially][social], I had spent so much time during the spring in the shop that I had almost lost touch with my freshman hall. I also realized that I was no where to being as American as I had imagined myself to be. I found South Park to be not funny. I could relate to very few people.  

The year ended pretty lackluster. I found myself stressed out and burnt out by late March. I had a fantastic Spring Break trip and it did a little bit to help me bring me on my feet, but I was in a hurry to get out of there. 

I spend that summer in Beijing, working for a software engineering company. I had less of an impact that I would have hoped, simply because I didn't quite have enough CS knowledge yet. I also had no idea what I wanted to do at all.  That summer was even harder personally. I was living all alone in Beijing. I didn't have any friends. Most weekday nights I did overtime because I didn't have anything else better to do. My grandma, whom I was very close with passed away while I was in Beijing. I had no one to share my sadness with, only me and my blog. I met a really good friend there who made those last few weeks actually bearable though. But that desperation also forced me to for the first time in my life take control of my life, send emails to strangers whom I had never met, ask friends for introductions so I could meet people for dinner. 

My summer wasn't very successful. Overall, I had a pretty crappy time there but it planted the seed of the idea of self-improvement. 

The problem with my freshman year was that I thought very high and mighty of myself when I started college. I put myself on a very high pedestal. I attribute that to reading Fountainhead the summer before college and was completely compelled to be the Roark in real life. Walsh and Roose and I had a little book club to talk about Fountainhead. When he pointed out that the Lonely Wandering Traveller painting on my wall indicated I wanted to emulate Howard Roark, it suddenly clicked that I was expecting too much from myself. I think that's dumb. Every freshman over-estimates their abilities and that book exacerbated it more because Roark had to go through a lot of hardship before his talent was recognized. I had wanted to be that tortured genius in real life too. But the sooner you are willing to accept that and move down from that pedestal, the faster you will open up to people.

Next part : Sophomore Year, Grit

This part determines how much grit you have. It's up to you to decide how to crawl out of it. It's a combination of lowering your standards and trying harder.

**Disclaimers** : these are very much my views, this post in particular. I have a realistic, unromantic, way-too-practical view on jobs.

Thanks to BoBo, DrLi and TomYimGong for being my first listeners. I also want to thank mbwong for being the first person to bring me to my senses and being such a supportive friend throughout my search.

####Why should I as an international consider working in the States?####

If you want to live the rest of your life in the States, then you pretty much have to. 

Ok. But why should I consider working in the states if I plan to eventually move back home? You should work in the States if there are more upsides to you working here. 

Let's start with the most practical reason, working here will help your career. America, the world's largest economy, has gotten some things right, especially in the world of banking, consulting and finance. So if you land a job with the top 5 Ibanks, top 3 consulting firms, top retail banks, the amount you will learn even in a few years will definitely outweigh whatever you would be learning at home. This is also true for specific industries. Some industries are overwhelmingly represented in the States for whatever reason i.e. computer science, aeronautical engineering, consumer retail. 

This is not always true though. It depends on what you want to do in the future and if there are opportunities at home to do the same. Especially if you're from another continent that isn't Europe, the economy back home may be a very different place. There are opportunities there that you could miss if you worked here.  You also have to think about whether these experience will translate well. Because when you're four years older and looking for a job at home with no relevant experience, you may lose out to younger fresh graduates. It doesn't make sense if your job requires a lot more geographic-specific knowledge like laws and regulations eg  working into any political/legal field. Or if your job requires a lot of intangibles like contacts/reputation, you can't really move to another country after establishing yourself as a musician or a political reporter.

But there's also other reasons why you might want to work here, for a loved one maybe, a higher quality of life, or simply a desire to experience life in another country. 

####What are the difficulties in getting a job in the States as a foreigner?####

To understand this, simply place yourself into the shoes of the new immigrant kid of the block trying to make friends at school. You're a nice boy but a little shy. You still have some difficulty expressing yourself in the local language. You don't have any friends who can help introduce you to the group. Even if you do make friends, it will be difficult for you to latch onto a group, because you will have trouble relating because you grew up in a different culture. 

That's typically what happens as a foreigner trying to find a job. Your don't have much of a business network to introduce you to potential employers. You don't have people to vouch for your abilities. There's also the higher perceived risk that you won't fit into the company. 

There's a whole host of reasons why an employer shouldn't hire you. The first one has nothing to with you being foreign or not. You aren't the most qualified person for the job. Second, you may be the most qualified but they don't think you will fit into company culture. This may have something to do with you being foreign. Third, protectionism. They want to have homegrown talent because they are more likely to stay with the company or being able to have a long term relationship with the company, whereas you may return home. There's also legal issues such as certain qualifications are much harder to get as a foreigner. Secondly, companies that do a lot of R&D often rely a lot on federal grants, which have stipulations that they can only hire citizens of the country.

If an employer has two candidates in front of him, abilities being equal, you want to give him the answers to why should he hire you over the other person who is local? This is where the intangibles and personality comes in. Ambition, drive is what employees are often looking for in their applicants. Business is not a charity. They don't need to do you a favor and hire you and train you. They are also taking a risk when they agree to hire you. You have to give them the reason that your productivity and growth will benefit the organization's future.

I tend to find that international students from other big cities in Asia like myself have the hardest time deciding. I suppose the aforementioned most important reason, economic opportunities, doesn't apply to them, as economic opportunities for us are arguably even better at home. Thus, your parents are able to apply more pressure to make you consider employment at home. (There's also a more ingrained culture of being filial in Asian cultures. Even today, in cities like Hong Kong, whole families live together in one apartment. Grandchildren are taught to take care and show respect towards their grandparents. The kind of mobility that exists in American cultures is shocking to a lot of people actually. There's talk about the increasing number of American youth that still live with their parents after starting to work. But in China, kids often live with your parents if they're close until they get married.You will never hear of an American kid paying off the mortgage of his parents house. But this is often the dream of many Asian kids, sometimes even first generation immigrants in American actually. This is perhaps why there is so much conflict between Asian immigrants and their first generation children. )

Obviously, this is a difficult decision. The cons which I haven't mentioned are numerous. Being away from your family, forgone opportunities at home, extra considerations when getting into relationships. It took me a while to finally decide as well. 

It's unfortunate but the one thing that we as foreigners don't have on our side is time. For college students, as soon as sophomore spring comes around, you should make up your mind. You don't have the time to wait around. You have to make a decision and then execute. You just have to be aggressive. To succeed anywhere as an outsider, you have to work a lot harder because you start from nothing. Start applying early, network, prepare for interviews, and ace the interviews. As an outsider, you don't get many opportunities. When you do, hang on with dear life. (Also, there's also the ticking bomb of getting work authorization as a foreigner. OPTs and CPTs are pretty much the American government's way of saying I don't want you to work in this country)

I wouldn't like anyone to take this post as an excuse to not try though. It's obviously hard and you will have to work hard for it. But I tell everyone who wants to try employment here, give it your very best shot. 

Reflecting on the last month, I also feel like I may have acted a little arrogant this past month since finding a job. It was poor judgement on my part. My only explanation is that I have worked hard for this and it was just a breath of relief after all those months of work. I now have a little experience in looking for tech jobs in the States. So if you have any questions, just drop me an email. Or if you have general questions about the logistics of CPTs and OPTs, I also know enough if you have questions.

_Q: how do you decide your major?_

*Advice* : Explore. Most people don't know what they want to do, or believe they know what they want to do. Don't be surprised if you wake up one day and decide you don't like doing this thing anymore. It's only natural. But be practical about the consequences. But don't expect to major in something with no employable skills and still expect to easily find a job. 

*Story* :  I came in thinking I wanted to do engineering. The whole idea of building things really appealed to me. I took ENGN3 and ENGN4 and didn't have too hard of a time. Then, I took ENGN51 : Electricity and Magnetism and (as did a lot of other people) realize that engineering required a lot more physics than I wanted and was prepared for.

I had originally planned to do Computer Engineering so was also taking the intro level computer science courses anyway. Computer Science came a lot easier to me so I decided to stick with it. My difficulty with E & M convinced me to drop the engineering and add the science. 

Looking back, I think there were two reasons I chose computer science. I like doing well in school and found that computer science came easier to me compared to everything else I tried. I did try comparative literature in freshman year but didn't enjoy or do well in the class. The second reason was that I wanted to work in the States post graduation. And it is obviously true that getting a job in the states as a foreigner is difficult for various reasons : work authorization, the foreigner factor. The only industry that was more meritocratic and immune from those influences was computer science so that was also a large factor.

_Q : how do you decide your work-life balance?_

*Advice* : It will always be an ongoing struggle. I think the balance is always shifting. I think there are times when you need to work hard and times when you don't. But keep in mind, that you're in college for a reason. "universities are a result of society believing itâ€™s a good investment for people our age to, arguably our physical prime, to engage in non-productive work, but completely immerse ourselves in academic study." So it is our duty to learn a lot during our time here. (There are also arguments that universities are just ways for the baby boomers to transfer the debt problem to the nation's youth.) 

Your grades are really the only thing you have to show for your academic experience so having acceptable grades is necessary. But different people have varying degrees of difficulty with the same material. So it's really what level you're comfortable with. 

*Story* A lot of people knew me as an academically intense person in high school. I like doing well in school (but I'm sure no one enjoys doing poorly in school.) And I think the desire to do well is simply a matter of pride. I still want to prove that I am smart and can get good grades. 

Grades provide a convenient measure by which we can again measure people by. Give someone GPA, and employees can size you up as a person, and predict how well you will do. So it's nice to do well because of the benefits you get from conventional systems. It's a simple metric by which other people can use to measure. People like to do this, because it's convenient. It makes sense if the measure has some direct correlation with success eg. basketball. This player has a stat line of 20 points and 10 rebounds each game, he's a good player but it doesn't necessarily mean he's going to win the finals, eg. Tracy McGrady. But for a lot of things, it isn't so clear.

So there's this whole relationship that it's important to do well as opposed to just it's nice to do well. It's important to do well if you want to go to Med School, Law School or Grad school. Getting good grades in college is a non-trivial matter. I've met a small number of people who can do it with very little effort. The people who tend to do well without the innate talent I argue are the ones who've restructured their lives to do well. They've become getting A machines.  Even with all those kinds of optimizations you make to your life to improve your learning experience, it still requires effort to do well. 

It's not necessay to get good grades in order to learn the material well, but often it's the case, and I do hope the grades are assigned in such a way that the above statement holds. Also, sometimes you simply don't care about learning enough of the material to get a good grade. Maybe, it's outside your comfort zone, you've come here and learnt what you wanted to, and now you're done.

There's a difference between getting good grades and learning a lot. You can get good grades without absorbing the material and vice versa. For a quick tutorial on that, go visit Cal Newport, Scott H Young. But in a larger sense, these people have adapted themselves in order to do well in an environment. You can say there's selection bias because people who tend to do well in the job market are those who ARE adaptive and hard workers.

I've been reading a lot of news articles lately, especially economics related ones. I said something about it [last time][news-reading]. 

I just wanted to write this here for someone to show this to me when I contradict myself later. 

Reading news makes you really angry because you realize how many fucked up people there are in power. It's probably the combination of events for example : PRISM, violence against protestors in Brazil, and just all around being more informed of how much shit large corporations do to increase their profits. The belief that people in power believe their interests are more important than the public's is really disgusting. [Case in point][fuck-lobbyist]. I for one don't really understand lobbyists. Lobbyists give politicians
money. Ok. But why does a politician want money? The government already pays a decent wage. To be elected to higher office of course. A)  The way politics is conducted in the US with money is also gross. B) This means the politician's primary interest is in his/her well-being, his/her need to be in higher office and not the people's. In which case, he shouldn't be representing the people if they are not his primary interest.

Secondly, the belief that the government knows better than you. The objectives they are trying to achieve is to bring greater prosperity to the people they govern. Sure, they may have more privileged information which could allow them to make more informed decisions but recent news suggests that they often do us at enormous cost to others, Guantanamo Bay, Afghan and Iraq War Diaries, and now even at the cost of their own people, PRISM. Politics really just sounds like power play, how you can force someone else to do exactly as you want them to, so
that you benefit the most out of the situation. Perhaps it's their ego that is driving them, the desire to be the most successful president, secretary of X in history of America. For them, the most important thing is their legacy. To them, politics is like a board game, efforts spent trying to win, to be dominant? You'll be surprised how little human beings can be content with. Sure, most people and myself included won't stop wearing Nike t-shirts or using iPhones because of impoverished work conditions.
But if someone told you that for every gallon of gas you got for $4 instead of $7 dollars you had to kill one Afghan, I think we would think differently. I think the general public has some morality in them. But as the Milgram experiment shows and movies like Bourne Identity suggest, being under orders and being in a privileged state of information where they have a greater objective of protecting the people sometimes turns off those morality valves.

And that brings us to POTUS. I was captured by him once, his hope, his books about his father, about his struggle with identity. We gave him the benefit of the doubt in the first term because of the economy. But some of the things that have been surfacing during the second term have made me reconsider his character. He's just another career politician, black, white, democratic, republican. He's only here to make a name for himself in the history books, but in the best interests of America, I'm not so sure anymore.

**EDIT**  
Turns out I wrote this about a month before I wrote the above. As I said, I like to contradict myself. I think I have to decide what I want. And this is part of a larger conversation of what I want out of life.

Me vs you. Selfishness   
having to do with common good versus bad  
if someone's going to bad, then it might as well be me  
as long as you are consistent throughout  
so that you will have a case under different value systems  
in the truly meritocratic world, there would be an objective function for everyone and everyone ranked by it  
but in our world, that's not true  
thus, it would be stupid not to take advantage of it.

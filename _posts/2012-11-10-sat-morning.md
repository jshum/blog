I know it's completely wrong to approach college like this. To only worry about work, to schedule my life around work but I can't do anything else. I can't enjoy the moment. I don't know how.

I don't want these years to be the best years of my life. I don't want them to be the good old days. I want them to be the precursor to the best days of my life. I want to learn as much as I can now. I want to change the world through my knowledge. I don't want to waste away drinking. 

To me, it just seems so wrong to spend so much money coming to this instituion and not learn anything substantial.

You know the triangle between work, social and sleep. You know how they could say you could pick two. That only works for humanities majors. If you're studying in a STEM field, you can't do good work without sufficient sleep.

My desire to succeed is sooo incredibly strong. To get a good job. To show all the nay-sayers what I've accomplished through determination and hardwork.

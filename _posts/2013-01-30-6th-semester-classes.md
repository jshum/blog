Just voicing my thoughts out loud.  

The idea of shopping period is frighteningly paralyzing. 
You're a kid in the candy shop and you have to choose 4-5 pieces of candy that you have to suck on or eat for at least three months. 
Not to mention that every time you pick something, you have one less thing to choose.
You're allowed to try it in the shop so you try a lot of different ones and you like each of them in different ways. But the shop is closing so you must choose relatively quickly.
And these pieces of candy define you. People will treat you differently because of them. You'll see different parts of the world with them. 

Started with 157, 155, 195F, AM261, MA153, MA101.  
Profs for 195F or 157 weren't as engaging as I had hoped.
I also realized that the prof for AM261 really wasn't as clear as I had always imagined him to be.  
Class size for 195F was also too large given there were only 1GTA + 3UTA.  
The profs for MA153 and MA101 were actually fine but I don't think I actually want to do that kind of math.
I gave it more thought and realized that I needed systems experience if I wanted to be a software engineer. So what about 167?
But I feel like I need to learn some stats but Chip is teaching AM166 and people have severely warned me about him.
So I looked for other stats classes and found graduate biostats classes in the PHP department. Professor seemed good. But I'll have to work hard to gain all the pre-requisite knowledge.
I also have to consider the fact that I'm graduating soon and don't have a lot of chances left to take cool classes. But the current workload of 157, 195F, stats is already bordering on the too much side. And you always have to balance it with the fact that some things you can learn by yourself with the help of a textbook and some video lectures. But there's some that you can only learn with some person standing in front of you. 

Three things suck when there's choices you have to make.

1. You don't really know what to choose because you don't know what you want. You don't and shouldn't know where you end up. But the best way to decide what to do is work backwards from your goal. 

2. Given 1, you're already not very sure what to choose. Furthermore, You're worried about choosing because your choosing criterion is random really. I'm convinced it's just a random process. There's no guide on how to pick classes. It's not even an art. It's guesswork. Then, you have to live with the consequences for three months, the good and bad parts. 

3. You worry about how these choices will define you.  It's frightening because I feel like I'm choosing my future and I know the opportunities to change my future are decreasingly slowly. It isn't that I hate my future right now. I just don't want to make a choice. I want to forever remain with the illusion that I can be anything I want to be. 

Choosing is impossible to master. Choosing is not deterministic at all. It depends on the moment, your emotion at the time, and most worryingly, it depends on the most recent idea/mood/thought that was put inside your head, something as simple as what someone had said or a youtube video you just watched. It's almost impossible to see the forest when you try to be introspective because invariably you fixate on a tree and it's almost impossible to voluntarily zoom-out. But just like a camera, everything outside your ring of focus is blurred out, which makes choosing. So we make imperfect choices. 

Another thing I've gleamed is that it's incredibly difficult to judge how well a class will go based on the first few lessons. I have experiences where the last few weeks totally transformed my opinion of a class. What you mostly gather is how well the lecturer is in class. But that also doesn't correlate to how much you will learn or how well you will do. This differs between technical and non-technical classes. In non-technical classes, you want a professor who is a good story-teller, but in a technical class you want a good explainer, someone who gives good motivations for learning something. We also end up adjusting to the lecturer's teaching style. For technical classes, most of the learning happens alone, reading the textbook, doing problem sets. Lecture comprises only a part of the learning experience of a class so it doesn't determine the class. But shopping period sort of emphasizes part where you decide a class after giving twenty minutes for a lecturer to prove his worth.  

I don't think I've made the best decision on my classes but it's time to work and it's time to move on. I probably will come to regret one or two of them of them at least and it makes me stressed because the stakes are high. You're often told to chase your dreams and dream big, whether it happens or not remains unknown. We can't really shape our lives in the way that we can't decide when we feel tired and want to give up. We can however help/bias ourselves to think certain ways. So I guess the moral is the same. Go for it like you'll reach the moon. But if it fails, forget all of it.

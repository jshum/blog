*life is messy*

life does't just stop when classes end.  
it doesn't start and end on predefined dates   
and modular cardboard boxes.  
it flows messily in and out of different parts of our lives.  
problems compound,  
mortgage interest abound.  
sometimes, it may seem like too much.  
but you must stay sane,  
and start small, because a good anything is built off of  
good fundamentals.  

p.s.

it's easy to focus on the negatives.  
but for once in my life,  
i'm going to focus on the good stuff.  
wow, i am a lucky bastard.

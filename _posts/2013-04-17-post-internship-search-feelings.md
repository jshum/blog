####The Highs####

* Feels good to have choices.
* I'm very proud of myself actually. Adjusting, not giving up, putting myself out there.
* I feel on top of the world actually. Finally, all the pieces coming together. Choices to be made and any option I choose would be great.
* Just really excited to be honest
* Obviously, this is a high point for me this year. Looking for full-time opportunities will probably be different again and is a whole other concern
* But finding something i want to do and being paid to do it is a great great feeling

####The Lows####

* Also feels weird you know.
* Am choosing a life path for myself
* By taking any of these options, i've decided another part of my life, piegon-holed myself one level more deep.
* There's doubt, whether the choice I make will be the right one for me.

####Doubts####

* The other question that comes to mind is what of this new life i'm trying to live. what does it actually mean?
* What does it mean to go into the "high society" of the bay area with all the smart people in tech?
* When I was young, I always felt i was meant for bigger things, for shiner, loftier, more ambitious ideas.
* Either my ambitions changed, or i stopped being a jerk. I realized it's really about the people you will meet, will hang out with.
* The top is a lonely place because everyone who got there is sufficiently egotistical and selfish
* The friends i've made here at Brown are the best i've ever made.
* I don't want this feeling of leaving them behind. Wish could bring them along for the trip.

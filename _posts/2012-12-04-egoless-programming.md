It's really sad when all of your code gets overwritten. 

This is where my character steps in.  
I could fight it and try to fight back for my changes.  
But at the same time, does it matter?   
After the due date, the code is going to be be stored as some bits and not be used ever again anyway.   
So why the big fuss.  
It's important to separate the criticism to you as a programmer and your code.  
But then again your code is a product of your skills as a programmer.

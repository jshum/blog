Iâ€™m going to do  a quick survey before I start the speech.  
For a quick show of hands, how many of you are in gade 9, grade10, grade 11, grade 12?  
I also want to ask for the country your first choice university is located in. Canada, HK, UK, USA, Australia.

Hi everyone, my name is Jason Shum. Many of you may better know me as Chris Shum's brother.   
I'm here today to give a talk, to tell you about your future. Many of you are in different parts of your high school career. Some of you are in grade 12, waiting to fulfill your conditional offers, some of you are in grade 10 and 11 and trying to juggle between extracurriculars and school work. I just wanted to give you a glimpse of what lies ahead of you, which will hopefully give you more of a perspective when you make a decision in the future.

Your teens and your 20's, I argue are the parts of your life most likely to shape your future. They roughly look like this, Sing 'Baby', try to grow up, Sing 'Boyfriend', finally hit puberty, but everyone has already forgotten about you. PAUSE if you're Justin Beiber.   
If you're normal like me, things roughly look like this. Wake up and you're in middle school, then it's a mad rush to survive high school. Then you apply to and get into colleges. Then you graduate and get your first job. Then you try to build you career. 

Let's talk about applying to colleges. I believe that no matter where you go to university, you can get a good education and have a good time. But the difference is the average student experience. There's a difference between a large public university with a great football team and a small private school with a crappy football team. That depends on the reputation of the school, the resources the college provides to each student, the different opportunities available to students, the available fields of study.

Most of what I am going to say is drawn from my own experience. I applied to colleges about three years ago and basically only to colleges in the States. So I'm only familiar with the admission process of USA colleges. I want to talk about what it takes to get into a top college in the states today. Things have changed even after the past two years and it has become more difficult to get into top colleges than it was before. Here are the facts. Acceptance rates have been going down every single year. We've always been fighting for the same spots with students from Mainland. In the past, Hong Kong students have had more resources so they have done better. Recently, mainland students have started out performing us. It's not enough to do well relative to other Hong Kong students anymore, you need to be a good candidate relative to every single Chinese applicant. If you don't mind, I'll be blunt and honest to you. I'm going to tell about the minimum scores I think you need to be seriously considered as a top college candidate.  I need to preface this by saying this is only a very small part of the picture. There's still a lot of other things like your application essays, your extracurriculars, your letters of recommendation. The minimum scores I think you need to be considered for the top colleges is about 2200 SAT score and 40/42 with the hard subjects. Here is the evidence. 

Here is a scatter plot of SAT scores vs GPA. The first thing you notice is that everything is crowded in the top right cluster. which means most of the students have very high SAT scores and GPAs. 

That's only a part of the picture. You can't just be a good student. You need to write a good application, you need to be involved with extra-curricular.  So be realistic. Research to realize where your statistics lie in the pool of applicants of the college you're applying to. There's a wealth of information out there which you can research about your college, the metrics of students accepted by any college. But again, college admissions is a funny game. Admission is based on these immeasurable and subjective construct of a good fit.  There's are no rules but only rule of thumbs. There will be disappointments, qualified candidates who don't get in, and surprises, students who don't look very well on paper but are 'perfect fits' for the school.

I'm going to move on and talk about going to college now. If anybody is interested in any of the other parts, or can help me get a job, I'm staying so we can talk after this.

Most of your life up until college has been on autopilot. How your life is structured is highly dependent on school, on your family, where you live, things you couldn't really control.  
But when you go to college, no one is telling you what to do, what to think, what to wear, who to befriend.  
In some ways, you have been given a blank slate again and you are the architect of your life. There are two things you get to redesign, your schedule and you.

Let's start with the concrete thing, time. You now have complete control over your time. You can organize and use your time and energy anyway you want. And exactly because you have so much freedom, and there's so much to do, you have to learn how to manage your time effectively.
I think time management is the singly most important skill that will determine how successful your college career is.

Let's just do some simple math. Let's say you sleep 8 hours a day. And add an hour before and after to account for waking up and getting ready for bed. Let's say you only eat lunch and dinner, so another 2 hours.  So we're left with about 12 hours per day, 12 x 7 = 84 hours in a week for you to allocate. Your job is to create a schedule and divide this time into going to class, studying, doing readings for classes, socializing, extra-curriculars, part-time job.

There are two things to bear in mind when you are thinking about your schedule.

The first is what you want to get out of college. You need to plan your life according to what you want to learn. Time adds up very quickly after four years. Let's say you dedicate 10 hours a week to some activity, whether it learning computer science, or cooking, or reading and watching television shows.  
There's 15 weeks of school every semester. You go to college for eight semesters so that's 120 weeks, which brings us to a total of 1200 hours of doing that activity. You can imagine you'll be pretty good at this. 

The second thing is how to optimize your schedule based on yourself.  
Everyone has a different body block, needs different amount of sleeps, can concentrate different lengths at a time. And it's up to you to figure out what works out the best for you. And there's a difference working hard and working smart. Three hours of flipping between facebook and Microsoft word after not having enough sleep the previous night is probably less effective than concentrating and focusing on the essay for an hour in a distraction free environment.
The effective output is most important.

and Now we move onto fuzzy and abstract things which I called you earlier. By that I mean the person you are, the values you represent. What is college also about? It's about growing up, maturing, deciding the person you are to become, your values.

College is a melting pot. There are a lot of young people. Everyone comes from a different background, different upbringing. If you're going abroad, the contrast will be even greater.  
Most of what your values up until now are largely based on something you think you believed in, what you parents told you, what your teachers told you, and what all the aunties told your mom to tell you. It's unavoidable because we're young. We don't have enough experience to decide what is good for us so it's better to stick to someone who has had that experience.

But in college, Nobody controls your life anymore. You are who you choose to be.  
Expand your universe. Your classes will challenge you to think. Your friends will argue with you. Your experiences in college will challenge your values.  
You may no longer live in a culture where the values you hold will make sense.  
There will be conflict whether it comes internally, culture shock, or externally arguments with other people. But college is a very forgiving environment. It's a safe space to make (reasonable) mistakes  
and get into fights, but that's what friends are for. The college experience itself tends to tie people together because of this shared experience of growing up together.

There are some values that you have taken for granted in your life and you should seriously think about those. I can't tell you who you will become but In general, you'll be a little bit more liberal in college, a little more progressive. you will become the things you spend the most time doing, and the people you surround yourself with. so choose wifely. Do the things you love and surround yourselves with people you respect. 

Conclusion:

Here's two things I want to point out to you. you are privileged. you're in a Chinese speaking city but in an English speaking school. All of you are bilingual, and many of you are looking to study abroad.  
Secondly, you are ahead of a lot of people in the world. you aren't in a rush to rush through college to support your parents, a burden which many of your parents carried. The world is yours for the picking. Have ambitious goals, work really hard for them.

You're spending four years here. It's not too short but isn't that long. you will Hopefully learn a lot more about yourself, what motivates you as a human being and grow up.  
It's a period of your life that many will call their prime, the golden years of your life. And the things that you end up remembering aren't the things you learn in class, but the nights you stay up until early hours in the morning discussing your hopes dreams fears and desires.

Questions:  
What is the difference between an ivy league and a top college?  
Downsides: rat race. everyone is so intelligent and competitive.  
Upsides: I think it eventually comes down to reputation and branding again.  
In terms of academics, education quality, I think most top colleges are similar in calibre.   
Employers are going to give you a second look because of your college. Your friends will often be other ivy league snobs.

How to get in a top college?  
It's incredibly difficult and I probably advise you to try for something in the future.   
If you're in grade 11, you're probably a bit late.  
EIther you have to start very young. You need to shape your profile completely in the direction of trying to get into ivy league.  
Or just aim for graduate school. 

What is college life like?  
Again, I can only draw from my own experience. I'm a computer science major. I work a lot, probably all of my waking hours during the weekdays. It's pretty difficult but I like it a lot.   
Learn technical skills. Learn how to make things.

Graduating from high school is a big deal. you should have all the necessary skills to become a responsible adult.  
IB was conceived a little differently. The purpose is to prepare you for college education, rather than for something else.  
The one feature about IB which is important is the emphasis on analysis and exams.
Something I wish someone had told me when i was younger was the importance of learning how to learn.  
Exams are high pressure intense situations. some people thrive and some don't  
but we love them because they provide simple standardized metrics to compare

Part 3  
Here's the right way to think about applying to colleges.  
As much as the university is admitting a student, you're also choosing a university.  
it's hard to say what things end up mattering. location, student life, sports, but i am biased, and this is what i caution you to remember.  
Remember that universities are a result of society believing it's a good investment for people our age to, arguably our physical prime, to engage in non-productive work, but completely immerse ourselves in academic study. that's a university. obviously, that does not hold as true today as it was man years ago, but that's the hope, right?

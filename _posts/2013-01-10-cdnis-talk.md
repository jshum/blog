Speech to CDNIS students  
students: lost, confused, stressed out, another leg up thing.  
goal: calm, motivate, inspire  

Hi everyone, my name is Jason Shum. Many of you may better know me as Chris Shum's brother.  

I'm here today to give a talk, to tell you about your future.  

Many of you are in different parts of your high school career. Some seniors just waiting to fulfill your IB predicted, others juggling ECAs and IB predicted's.  
I just want to give you a glimpse of what lies ahead of you, which will hopefully give you more of a perspective to help you decide what is important for you now.

Your teens and your 20's, I argue are the most likely parts of your life to shape your future. They roughly look like this,

1. Dreaming through Middle school (Don't worry about it. No one knows what they did)
2. Surviving High school (You're here)
3. Applying to/Getting into college
4. Going to College (I'm here)
5. Getting your first job
4. Building your career

If you're Justin Beiber, your teens and 20's look like this. 

1. Sing 'Baby'
2. Trying to grow up
3. Still trying to grow up.
4. Sing 'Girlfriend'
5. Trying to growup some more
6. Sing 'Wife'
7. Nobody cares becuase everyone has forgotten about him.

Let me just address Part 3 fairly briefly.  
I believe that no matter where you go to university, you can get a good education and have a good time.   
But the difference is the average student experience. There's a difference between a large public university with a great football team and a small private school with a crappy football team.  
That depends on the reputation of the school, the resources the college has, the different opportunities available to students.  

If you want to guarantee that you get a fantastic education, go to a reputable school known for the field you want to study, where you will meet many intelligent peers and have lots 
of opportunities.  
To get into those schools, you have to work hard throughout high school, get the grades, join an extra-curricular which demonstrates your passion.  
But college admissions is a funny game, there's mostly guidelines and no rules. There are a lot of 'whats' and 'oh my Gods'  
Just bear in mind, you will like wherever you go to school.  
 
I'm going to talk about Part 4 today. If anybody is interested in any of the other parts, or can help me get a job, I'm staying so we can talk after this.

Most of your life up until college has been on autopilot. How your life is structured is highly dependent on school, on your family, where you live, things you couldn't really control.  
But when you go to college, no one is telling you what to do, what to think, what to wear, who to befriend, what to eat.  
In some ways, you have been given a blank slate again and you are the architect of your life.  

Let's start with the concrete stuff, time.  
You now have complete control over your time. You can organize and use your time and energy anyway you want.   
We're going to look at the average week of a college student. The point of this exercise is for you to think about how much of your life you can design, depending on what you want to gain out of college.  
I'm going to provide a general overview of college life.  

Let's say you sleep 7 hours a day. And add an hour before and after to account for waking up and getting ready for bed.  
Let's say you only eat lunch and dinner, so another 2 hours.   
So we're left with about 12 hours per day, 12 x 7 = 84 hours in a week for you to allocate. (To be fair, there's a lot of downtime like traveling in between places, procrastination that we haven't accounted for)   
That's a lot of time. A full time job in America is only 40 hours a week, which is about 2/3 of your life on the weekdays.  

I want you to think about two things.   
The first is what you want to get out of college. There's an infamous triangle that people often talk about, that looks like sleep, academics, social.  
If you want two, you have to give up one. You can all do three if you do a bit of everything.

The second is what you can accomplish in four years.   
Let's say you dedicate 10 hours a week to some activity, whether it learning computer science, or some combination of cooking, reading and watching television shows.  
There's 15 weeks of school every semester. You go to college for eight so that's 120 weeks, which brings us to a total of 1200 hours of doing that activity.

In college, there's so much you can choose between. Classes, extracurriculars, sports teams, hanging out with friends, part time jobs.   
Each and every one of you are students first.  You're going to taking 4 to 5 classes every semester.   
We usually classify classes in terms of their weekly time commitment. A 5-8 hour commitment is considered minimal. That basically entails going to class and maybe doing a 2-3 hours of work a week outside of that. 10 hour is about standard, 15-20 hours is a lot of work. That's about 10-15 hours of work outside of class.

There's obviously a lot of variety in between all types of class combinations.   
Let's just look at two possible choices.   
An easy freshman semester consisting of one 5 hour class and  three 10 hour classes. So that's 35 hours of work a week, leaving you about 50 hours.   
That's pretty nice. You can basically spread your work pretty leisurely over the week and basically go out or hang out with friends on the weekend.   
You still have a lot of time left to choose two to three ECAs to commit to and still have time to make lots of friends.

There are two things to factor in when imaging your schedule, your grade level and your major.
Classes get more difficult as you have a higher grade level. Grades start becoming more important when you are looking for a job. There's more pressure to work and do the readings. So I would say a typical upperclassman takes one 20-hour class, two 10-hour classes and one 8-hour class. That's about 48 hours of work a week. 

Obviously, math/science/engineering majors have much more requirements and the classes are a lot more time consuming.  
My classes were probably 50 hours in freshman year and about 60 hours this past semester.   
You get the picture. You have a lot of time. A lot of it can be designated for classes or whatever you want. It comes down to what you want out of it.

Now we move onto the second thing on what to expect in college life. It's growing up, maturing, deciding the person you are to become, your values.

You need to realize you're in a place a lot of young people. Everyone comes from a different background, different upbringing. If you're going abroad, the contrast will be even greater.
And this is the time you need to start exploring.   
Most of what your values up until now are largely based on something you think you believed in, what you parents told you, what your teachers told you, what your friends told you and what all the aunties   
told your mom to tell you. It's unavoidable because we're young. We don't have enough experience to decide what is good for us so it's better to stick to someone who has had that experience.  
But in college, you are free to take on a completely new life if you want, be a completely different person.

Nobody controls your life anymore. You are who you choose to be.  
Expand your universe. Your classes will challenge you to think. Your friends will argue with you. Your experiences in college will challenge your values.   
You are no longer live in the world where the values you hold will make sense.  
There will be conflict whether it comes internally, culture shock, or externally arguments with other people. But college is a very forgiving environment. It's a safe space to make (reasonable) mistakes  
and get into fights, but that's what friends are for. The college experience itself tends to tie people together because of this shared memories of growing up.

Conclusion:  
Here's two things I want to point out to you. you are privileged. you're in a Chinese speaking country. All of you are bilingual, and many of you are looking to study abroad.  
Secondly, you are ahead of a lot of people in the world. you aren't in a rush to rush through college to support your parents. The world is yours for the picking. Have ambitious goals, work really hard for them.   

You're spending four years here. It's not short and it's not long. It's something that many will call the prime moments of their lives, the golden years of your life, and hopefully for many of you where you will learn a lot more about yourself, what motivates you as a human being.

Your 20's should be like this:  
Work hard, try different things, use your brain and follow your heart.

Extras:

Part 2:  
Graduating from high school is a big deal. you should have all the necessary skills to become a responsible adult.  
IB was conceived a little differently. The purpose is to prepare you for college education, rather than for something else.  
The one feature about IB which is important is the emphasis on analysis and exams.
Something I wish someone had told me when i was younger was the importance of learning how to learn.   
Exams are high pressure intense situations. some people thrive and some don't  
but we love them because they provide simple standardized metrics to compare  
But the purpose is trying to enforce something more important. You shouldn't be cramming for IBs. You need to study, but over the last two years,  
you should have learnt everything you needed.

Part 3  
how to choose a university?  
(the deceiving pastures of college life)

Here's the right way to think about applying to colleges.   
As much as the university is admitting a student, you're also choosing a university.  
it's hard to say what things end up mattering. location, student life, sports, but i am biased, and this is what i caution you to remember.  
Remember that universities are a result of society believing it's a good investment for people our age to, arguably our physical prime, to engage in non-productive work, but completely immerse ourselves in academic study. that's a university. obviously, that does not hold as true today as it was man years ago, but that's the hope, right?

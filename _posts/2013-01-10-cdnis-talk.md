Speech to CDNIS students  
students: lost, confused, stressed out, another leg up thing.  
goal: calm, motivate, inspire

Hi everyone, my name is Jason Shum. Many of you may better know me as Chris Shum's brother.

I'm here today to give a talk, to tell you about your future.

Many of you are in different parts of your high school career. Some seniors just waiting to fulfill your IB predicted, others juggling ECAs and IB predicted's.  
I just want to give you a glimpse of what lies ahead of you, which will hopefully give you more of a perspective to help you decide what is important for you now. 

Your teens and your 20's, I argue are the most likely parts of your life to shape your future. They roughly look like this,

1. Dreaming through Middle school (Don't worry about it. No one knows what they did)
2. Surviving High school (You're here)
3. Applying to/Getting into college
4. Going to College (I'm here)
5. Getting your first job
4. Building your career

If you're Justin Beiber, your teens and 20's look like this. 

1. Sing 'Baby'
2. Trying to grow up
3. Still trying to grow up.
4. Sing 'Girlfriend'
5. Trying to growup some more
6. Sing 'Wife'
7. Nobody cares becuase everyone has forgotten about him.

Let me just address Part 3 fairly briefly.  
I believe that no matter where you go to university, you can get a good education and have a good time.   
But the difference is the average student experience. There's a difference between a large public university with a great football team and a small private school with a crappy football team.  
That depends on the reputation of the school, the resources the college has, the different opportunities available to students.

If you want to guarantee that you get a fantastic education, go to a reputable school known for the field you want to study, where you will meet many intelligent peers and have lots of opportunities.  
To get into those schools, you have to work hard throughout high school, get the grades, join an extra-curricular which demonstrates your passion.  
For the US in particular, admission is based on these immeasurable construct of a good fit. So write an creative and well thought-out personal essay, research the school enough to write the supplement.  
But college admissions is a funny game, there's mostly guidelines and no rules. There are a lot of disappointments and surprises.
 
I'm going to talk about Part 4 today. If anybody is interested in any of the other parts, or can help me get a job, I'm staying so we can talk after this.

Most of your life up until college has been on autopilot. How your life is structured is highly dependent on school, on your family, where you live, things you couldn't really control.  
But when you go to college, no one is telling you what to do, what to think, what to wear, who to befriend, what to eat.  
In some ways, you have been given a blank slate again and you are the architect of your life.

Let's start with the concrete thing, time.  
You now have complete control over your time. You can organize and use your time and energy anyway you want.   
And exactly because you have so much freedom, and there's so much to do, you have to learn how to manage your time effectively.   
I think time management is the singly most important skill that will determine how successful your college career is. 

Let's say you sleep 8 hours a day. And add an hour before and after to account for waking up and getting ready for bed.  
Let's say you only eat lunch and dinner, so another 2 hours.   
So we're left with about 12 hours per day, 12 x 7 = 84 hours in a week for you to allocate.   
Your job is to divide this time into going to class, studying, doing readings for classes, socializing, extra curriculars, part-time job.  

There are two things to bear in mind when you are thinking about your schedule. 

The first is what you want to get out of college. You need to plan your life according to what you want to learn.   
There's an infamous triangle that people often talk about, that looks like sleep, academics, social.  
If you want two, you have to give up one. You can do all three if you do a bit of everything and don't mind not doing well in any of them.

Four years is a long time. it adds up very quickly. Let's say you dedicate 10 hours a week to some activity, whether it learning computer science, or cooking, or reading and watching television shows.  
There's 15 weeks of school every semester. You go to college for eight so that's 120 weeks, which brings us to a total of 1200 hours of doing that activity.  
So you also have to figure out how you want to use your time. 

The second thing is how to optimize your schedule based on yourself.   
Everyone has a different body block, needs different amount of sleeps, can concentrate different lengths at a time. And it's up to you to figure out what works out the best for you. And there's a difference between studying and effective studying. Three hours of flipping between facebook and microsoft word is probably less effective than concentrating and focusing on the essay for an hour.  
As a teaching assistant, I often hear 'I've spend this many hours on a problem and still can't figure it out.' but that's a meaningless phrase.  The effective output is most important.

Now we move onto the second thing on what to expect in college life. It's growing up, maturing, deciding the person you are to become, your values.

College is a melting pot. There are a lot of young people. Everyone comes from a different background, different upbringing. If you're going abroad, the contrast will be even greater.  
Most of what your values up until now are largely based on something you think you believed in, what you parents told you, what your teachers told you, and what all the aunties told your mom to tell you. It's unavoidable because we're young. We don't have enough experience to decide what is good for us so it's better to stick to someone who has had that experience.

But in college, Nobody controls your life anymore. You are who you choose to be.  
Expand your universe. Your classes will challenge you to think. Your friends will argue with you. Your experiences in college will challenge your values.   
You are no longer live in the world where the values you hold will make sense.  
There will be conflict whether it comes internally, culture shock, or externally arguments with other people. But college is a very forgiving environment. It's a safe space to make (reasonable) mistakes  
and get into fights, but that's what friends are for. The college experience itself tends to tie people together because of this shared memories of growing up.

There are some values that you have taken for granted in your life and you should seriously think about those. In general, you'll be a little bit more liberal in college, a little more progressive. I can't tell you who you will become but i can tell you that who you will become will depend on the things you spend the most time doing, and the people you surround yourself with. You will become the average of your friends so choose well.

Conclusion:

Here's two things I want to point out to you. you are privileged. you're in a Chinese speaking country. All of you are bilingual, and many of you are looking to study abroad.  
Secondly, you are ahead of a lot of people in the world. you aren't in a rush to rush through college to support your parents. The world is yours for the picking. Have ambitious goals, work really hard for them. 

You're spending four years here. It's not short and it's not long. In the perspective of your life, you will Hopefully learn a lot more about yourself, what motivates you as a human being and grow up.   
It's something that many will call the prime moments of their lives, the golden years of your life. And the things that end up mattering aren't your grades, but the nights you stay up until 2AM talking with your best friends. 

Your 20's should be like this:  
Work hard, try different things, use your brain and follow your heart.

Extras:

Part 2:  
Graduating from high school is a big deal. you should have all the necessary skills to become a responsible adult.  
IB was conceived a little differently. The purpose is to prepare you for college education, rather than for something else.  
The one feature about IB which is important is the emphasis on analysis and exams.  
Something I wish someone had told me when i was younger was the importance of learning how to learn.   
Exams are high pressure intense situations. some people thrive and some don't  
but we love them because they provide simple standardized metrics to compare

Part 3  
how to choose a university?  
(the deceiving pastures of college life)

Here's the right way to think about applying to colleges.   
As much as the university is admitting a student, you're also choosing a university.  
it's hard to say what things end up mattering. location, student life, sports, but i am biased, and this is what i caution you to remember.  
Remember that universities are a result of society believing it's a good investment for people our age to, arguably our physical prime, to engage in non-productive work, but completely immerse ourselves in academic study. that's a university. obviously, that does not hold as true today as it was man years ago, but that's the hope, right?

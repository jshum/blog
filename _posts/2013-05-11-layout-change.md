![v1][1] Previous layout

Decided that I've had enough of the old layout and the colors are too depressing so I switched it up.

![v2][2] New layout

I've also moved away from the idea of a blog roll to a landing page for my home page. Hopefully, tags/archive will provide enough navigational guidance. What do you think?

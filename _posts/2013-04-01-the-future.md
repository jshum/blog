had a pretty good conversation with Hak on the way back from Boston to conclude my spring break.

We talked a lot about the future and trends/technologies we saw on the horizon which were going to be disruptive to the world. 

Items
* Graphene : solving the battery problem will solve a whole bunch of problems like high mileage cars, wireless devices, portable devices for everything that previously required a strong power supply since we already solved the problem of transmitting information wirelessly. (Also imagine a world where we could see a larger round of the EM spectrum and see radio waves passing in the atmosphere)
* Increasingly smart devices : how technology generates less dollars worth of economic activity compared to the past. My dad said something about how 1 dollar of stimulus used to generate 7 dollars of economic activity. Now it generates less, maybe 5. 
* Wearable technology capturing biometrics. 
* Transportation of the future : small little pods that will go onto big trains.

Trends 
* Automation : A lot of jobs are becoming obsolete due to technology. On one hand, we are a lot more productive because of technology. Technology has also made us lose our focus with things like facebook and farmville. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the two booming industries of the future will be entertainment and technology.
* Two demographics in the future. Super technical and normal people who are hidden from the details by all the user interfaces. Technology is the closest thing we have to magic.
* Size of transistors. Moore's law has been on our side for the last few decades. but now we are getting to the limits of physics. The transistors we now are so small that it will soon be impossible to make transistors than they already are. This means in the short future, we can't count on increasing processor speeds anymore. We will realize that there are optimization problems that are not worth solving anymore simply because they require more resources than there are in the universe.
* How will big data interact with privacy/anonymity? The fundamental idea in machine learning is that we need data to train our algorithms so lots of companies/devices rely on that to improve.It is inevitable, one might say neccessary, that every person will become a data point. When will consumers freak out about how much is known about them? California just introduced the 'Right to Know' act that would let consumers find out who has their personal data. Our property not only includes what is on our financial statements but also information about ourselves.  
* Consider the Target example of how a computer algorithm was able to tell a teenager was pregnant before the father found out. Imagine that we apply this to datasets to location history and purchase information. We would be able to identify patterns and basically predict activity. We are relying on the power of statistics and the fact that human behavior is well behaved to guess intentions. We could apply this to criminial activity. Minority report is not that far away. 

What does it mean?
* Progress in civilization is when we have more trust in the system. Trust that your flimsy 100mpg car won't be smushed by an suv. Trust in society/technology. iRobot
* Samsung will become the company that controlled everything like Skynet for Korea. 
* SciFi and its importance in inspiring the next generation. For a lot of people in the previous generation, StarTrek did a lot to inspire them to work in technology. We haven't had anything similar for our generation of young minds.

tldr: "Getting a little disillusioned by the gaza conflict. Neither side is willing to put down their weapons in fear of being vulnerable but having that mentality is exactly what will prevent a resolution"

Why can't we all just be friends?

There's a few things I've been thinking about since watching the [iron dome][2]:  
One of them is that we're in a perpetual arms race. The way to save people isn't to come up with better defense.  
By game theory, it's better to keep developing if you can until everyone ceases fire.  
But that's bad. Offense always comes before defence.  
By the time, we can develop something that stops other things, we've already developed much more powerful things to destroy tings.  
The best solution is to ceasefire.  
When we fight wars, we always try to demonize the other side. We're try to make them look as bad as possible when in fact we need to paint them as humane people, with families, with life.

The thing I just want to point out is that when you get into a war mentality where you are just trying to survive from one day to the next.  
A lot of social constructs break down like that.  
You don't trust anyone. You're just trying to help yourself.

And to restore peace to an area. We have to allow that structure to organically grow back.  
People are dependent on their relationships. When a person loses all his relationships, he loses focus.

[some perspective on what happens in israel][1]
We're all just fighting for the same piece of land.

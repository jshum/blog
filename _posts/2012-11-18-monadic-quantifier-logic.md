title: "thoughts on language from Monadic quantifier logic"
---

Logic is one of the courses I'm taking this semester.
It hasn't been very philosphical in the past because we were only doing truth-functional logic. But now that we have moved onto a system with more expressive power, Monadic quantified logic which is really a lot simpler than what it sounds like, there's a little bit more philosophy in the mix.

One of the concepts that has been defined is the universe of discourse.
For example: look at the following schema.

Hx: x is happy
(\forall x)(Hx)
In this context, this means everything is happy.
But if we stipulate the universe of discourse to everyone at a party, we have a very different meaning. 

In this type of logic, the universe of discourse has to satisfy two conditions
 * non-empty
 * stable (should not change between schemas)

But this are very intuitive notions right? This is because we deal with these all the time in communication. Whenever we communicate, there is an implicit universe of discourse.

But unlike the one in logic, our universe of discourse is unstable. When you are debating or arguing with someone. You both start with your own universe of discourse. But as you both make valid points, the universe changes to accomodate the other person's universe until it becomes the same. 

And you could say that when you use the same sentnece in universe of discourse that is much larger or much smaller, it becomes either hilarious or profoundly deep.

From my programming languages, logic and theory of computation class this semester, I've had a lot more exposure to small but surprisingly powerful languages.

ParselTongue, very simple language, allowed surprisingly complex languages to be written.
PeonoArithmetic, very simple system, can also prove surprisingly difficult math things.
Mondaic quantifier logic, very simple, but you can simulate a large amount of natural language.

In analyzing a formal system/language, looking deeply into its syntax and semantics to determine what what limitations do we remove from a language when we add specific constructs, you find out the key pieces that give a system its power.

Unlike these formal systems though, Natural languages have almost no syntax. The grammar of a language determines the syntax but it isn't that strict. One could even say that literature is constantly trying to expand the syntax and semantics of a language, especially true in poetry.

Last remark:
Isn't that funny that we keep living and only sometimes realize certain things about the way we are living? Unlike these formal systems, we don't build our lives and examine their implications. Before anything else, we've been conditioned to live, how to survive from one day to the next. And we may never understand certain things about the way we live. You may never think about the health implications of sit down toilets for example.

## Log

1. 2012-11-26: ignored the posterous posts from tags.html and JB/tags_list using {{unless tag[0] == 'posterous }}. There must be a better way to do it
2. 2013-01-03: added post.tldr to the front matter. So now if you specify tldr, it will appear at the bottom of the post. Will add a page with only tldrs soon hopefully.
3. 2013-01-21: added search using indextank-jquery and jekyll_indextank. Search is accessed through search.html now, links to google's hosted libraries are added to default.html in layouts/default.html. Next step: switch to a search box on the navigation bar.
4. 2013-01-29: added {% unless post.nosocial %} to the atom.xml page
5. 2013-02-06: added a tldr.html page which is quite nice.

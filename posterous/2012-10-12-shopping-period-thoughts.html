there&#39;s a lot of stress during shopping period.<br />because in the back of your head there&#39;s always the question of whether the classes you think you&#39;re going to take right now is the right combination of classes, and even the right permutation of classes in terms of your academic career.<p /> there&#39;s questions like is he/she a good professor. will i be more prepared for this class if i take this later or next semester? will this class not receive the attention its due because i&#39;m talking all of these other time-consuming classes?<br /> if i take this class now, will it free up my semester much more in future semesters?<p />for the first time though, since i&#39;ve only just finished most of the core pre-requisites for my major that i&#39;ve been able to choose to take advanced classes this semester. <br /> and things get very diversified very quickly so choosing these advanced classes has almost been like choosing the subfield i want to work in in the future.<p />so it&#39;s very reassuring and satisfying to talk to someone who understands exactly the predicament you are in right now and can offer some advice on classes,professors to take and avoid, <br /> and who will agree with your selection of your courses and tell you that you&#39;re on the right track<p />because advanced courses diversify so quickly and so many people have taken different permutations of the same courses, there will be a lot of different and contradicting opinions.<br /> but i think at the end of the day is what interests you. you have to choose classes based on the subject matter after a whole day of classes and different activities you still want to spend three hours thinking and be frustrated about.

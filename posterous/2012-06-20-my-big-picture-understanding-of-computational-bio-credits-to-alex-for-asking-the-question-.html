<div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:37 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">me</span>: our understanding of biology in the last two centuries has been pretty limited to observations</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>observations of species and stuff</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:39 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>but starting in last 100 years, our understanding has expanded to the cell and subsequently DNA</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>and here&#39;s where things get really interesting</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:40 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>you know we always talk about binary as 0 or 1</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>so here&#39;s life&#39;s parallel to binary, DNA, composed of four alphabets: A, G, C, T</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:41 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>and when scientist dig deeper, they realize that life is basically coded by DNA. Every part of us is encoded in thet strand of stuff</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>so if you figure out what the DNA is doing, then you can figure out a lot of other things</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:42 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>so here&#39;s the problem. Nobody knows what the DNA is doing. we didn&#39;t design it. so to us, it&#39;s all just a really really long sequence of AGCT&#39;s whose end product somehow is life</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>and the main efforts are now to understand howwww it does it</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:43 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>so a large large facet of computational bio deals with DNA</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>how can we extract information about DNA? quite simply, you change it up, stick in an organism and see what happens</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:44 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>one thing that&#39;s being done a lot now is comparative genomics, which is comparing the genes of two speices and see if there&#39;s a specific strand of DNA responsible for it</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:45 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>but the complication of DNA is that a lot of it is rubbish. it&#39;s rubbish data and doesn&#39;t really do anything</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:46 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>and somehow unlike computer code, life has a pretty large tolerance for error in DNA</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>so trying to separate out the noise from the information is another problem</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>i ahven&#39;t really actually explained the computational part of the word i guess</span></span></div> <div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:49 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>the computational comes in for two reasons. 1) the tasks that have to be done are toooo long and repetitive, like comparing two DNA sequences. so you want machines to do that. and it&#39;s quite easy to manipulate strings with machines. extracting information of strings isn&#39;t surprisingly a very commonly topic come across by computer scientist, so there&#39;s a lot of overlap, or algorithms that have to be refined a little before they can be applied to boilogical problems</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:51 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>2) scientist now have a few rules about biology that they know. and what computational boilogy do is run a few simulations with these rules and see what happens. because it&#39;s much cheaper to run a simulation on a computer than to do an actual experiment</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:54 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>the end goal is this, that with only someone&#39;s DNA, we can tell everything about a human, and &quot;improve&quot; it. the hardware is getting there: reading one person&#39;s DNA used to take couple million dollars (human genome project) and it now only costs 2000 USD to sequence your DNA. computational bio is the software to now go through all this A G C T and get something useful out of it</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">9:55 AM </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>the research my professor does is trying to get information about the cacner by comparing DNA&#39;s of people with the same type of cancer, and hopefully try to &quot;cure&quot; it.</span></span></div><div><span style="display: block; float: left; color: #888;">  </span><span style="display: block; padding-left: 6em;"><span>that&#39;s my understanding of comp bio, hope it wasn&#39;t too much</span></span></div>

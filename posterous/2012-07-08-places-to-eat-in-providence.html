1) federall hill: far away, probs half an hour by walking but great italian food. (~$20-30 per person)<br />2) downtown by providence place. there&#39;s a few expensive places to eat (chris ruth steakhouse, mccormick schmick, union station brewery. ~$20-30 per person)<br /> 3) wickenden, street is really close to india point if you went to fireworks. less upscale than the other two but also acceptable food. sakura, japanese food, is good. a cool one would be Abyssinia, which is ethiopian food. (~$15)<br /> 4) wayland avenue, go east on waterman for about 20 minutes. residential area. a number of nice places there i.e Twist

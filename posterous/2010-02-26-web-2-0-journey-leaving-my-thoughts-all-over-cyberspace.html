<b>web 2.0 journey, leaving my thoughts all over cyberspace</b><div>it started with xanga.</div><p /><div>then upgraded to wordpress</div><p /><div>then added facebook, so it was facebook notes + wordpress</div> <p /><div>then too many ppl read facebook, so i dropped it</div><p /><div>then used evernote for a very short while before i gave up</div><p /><div>then i twittered and synced my facebook status. still, too many people read it and didn&#39;t allow enough depth</div> <p /><div>then i found posterous and now becomes wordpress + posterous</div><p /><div>it&#39;s a very pointless list, one that brings me to no conclusion. saying this does not tell you where i might end up next or that i&#39;ll stay on posterous forever. it&#39;s not that it&#39;s bad but the purpose and intended audience of my musings change. subsequently, the medium has to change. i&#39;ve left my trail in five to six sites. it does somewhat scare me that it could all be gone in a server crash or barred from me until i become a pro user. oh wells. it&#39;s merely the growth of the web generation. we&#39;ve gotta improve and change like the web, can&#39;t keep stagnant and loyal. change happens so quickly that we can&#39;t be loyal or else we&#39;re left behind.</div>

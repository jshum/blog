world is too complex for anyone of us to understand the entirety of<br />there are too many interactions between parts of the complex system for anyone to predict what will actually happen<br />when you introduce some change, and people are quick to judge others by a short microscope view of one&#39;s actions. this is further worsened by personalized views. it is now so easy for us to find information that supports our own view points. so even the most well-intentioned people are likely to be seen as villains.<br /> some smart people have also come to the conclusion that it is not worth the risk to try to impact this world in a positive away.<br />so many choose to hide away with their family and their work<p />but more than ever, we are in dire need of individuals who can help us navigate through this extreme mess.<br /> rich people are not necessarily smart. actually, they need some of kind fixation on money and ignorance and disregard for most other things.<br />with social immobility and income disparity, it is harder than ever to ascend the economic ladder while it is easier than ever to slide down in it so we are left with a stagnant society without any mobility.<br /> as the world has become more complex, our leaders have resorted to even more rhetoric and sketchy statistics. there are a lot of people who don&#39;t understand the complete picture. their final weapon is positive thinking, hoping hope itself will bring us back to prosperity.<p /> that is the problem of our society.

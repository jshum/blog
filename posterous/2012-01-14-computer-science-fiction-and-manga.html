Dear soul lost in cyberspace who has wandered onto this piece of cyber trash,<p /><div>here are some things that i&#39;ve been finding from google these few days:</div><div>ever since my defect to computer science, i&#39;ve been looking at interesting mangas, fiction to make me a real nerd.</div> <p /><div>Manga:</div><div>tried Neon Genesis Evangelis</div><div>it&#39;s rated pretty high and many people like it, talking about the multi layered religious symbolism within the series. i agree it&#39;s different. but maybe i was looking for a exciting and enjoyable read when i picked it up. i ended up with something pretty gritty and feeling pretty bored.</div> <p /><div>Ghost in the Shell</div><div>there&#39;s manga, tv series and film. both tv series and film seem to based on manga but film is shorter and set in a different time. there are many titles but really only cover two arcs.</div> <div>futuristic crime manga. should be nice.</div><p /><div>Books</div><p /><div>reading this blog entry by a cs professor: <a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/31">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/31</a></div> <div>he mentioned the names, Neuromancer, Snow Crash and Vernor Vinge. All the reviews on amazon look pretty good.</div><p /><div>Neuromancer - William Gibson, hacker killed but revived to defeat an AI</div><div> Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson hacker named hiro tries to save world from drug called &quot;Swow Crash&quot;</div><div>Vernor Vinge&#39;s books such as A Fire in the deep, involves inter-galatic space, artificial intelligence.</div> <div>ender&#39;s game, artificial intelligence kids used to fight something. also sci-fi but no cs involved.</div><p /><div>the first two sound like what i need but i tend to shy away from books with inter-galatic space. that&#39;s because they usually involve omnipresent artificial intelligence machines and you know where it goes after that, iRobot, terminator etc. but i maybe gave them a shot.</div> <p /><div>quite a few mangas always turn out to have bad endings, i guess that&#39;s why you should never serialize work unless you have it all planned out already. </div>

i just spent a whole day doing the right thing<div>hanging out with my fds that i met at our school of children from affluent families</div><div>buying winter clothing for my ivy league education</div><div>buy two books to prepare for my russian literature course, a subject which i realize now will have no practical impact on my future. </div> <p /><div>and to come back to see a video about happiness to hear that more is not better. </div><div>and to read that an ivy league education will not give me anything practical, but further promotes me to vanity and a misguided sense of entitlement, of destined success, &quot;being holders of power but not its critics&quot;</div> <div><a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/">http://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/</a></div><div>in the end, i won&#39;t know how to talk to a plumber</div> <p /><div>i need a good cleansing period of solitude at home.</div>

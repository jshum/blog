	free, happy, big, seeing more
    	enjoying the world<p />to be truly free, you need to not be bogged down by anything<br />but to be happy, you need to make those human connections, you need to commit and sacrifice<br />so does being happy contradict being free.<p /> the world is so infinitely big that you can never assume you can come close to seeing all of it<br />i guess even if you want to see the whole world <br />you have to realize that you&#39;re world is capped at 150.<br /> when you gain, you lose something.<p />if time is finite and if you&#39;re not wasting time, do you see more by walking to more places?

	on war
    	you can&#39;t find any dew-eyed teenager soldier walking on the frontlines because they&#39;re all dead.<br />all of who enter the frontlines with a giddy sense of excitement and adrenaline never stay the same for too long, <br /> as war is quick to wake everyone from their dreams. <p />there is no bravery in war, only recklessness.<br />there is no chivalry in war, only slyness and outwitting the opponent.<br />war is a zero-sum game, it&#39;s one death between the two of us.<br /> kind souls are the one killed<br />one bullet is all it takes for the warm blood of a dew-eyed teenager to be strewn all across your hands.<br />better men don&#39;t make better soldiers<br />but cold blooded, lethal, selfish, merciless men do.<br /> this is not game, there&#39;s no second chance. <br />one wrong move and all that is left of you is a dog tag. <p />so now i will ask, why war?<br />why do something that begets more hatred?

	all the worlds to explore, yet only time for one
    	there are a lot of worlds to explore. and i wish i could look and see all of them. but the fact is that if i want to be good at something, i can only look at a very few of them or even only one. and i love so many things: classical music, engineering, physics, philosophy, literature, economics, but the fact is i don&#39;t have that much time to spend on all of them. if i close myself in a lab, i might be able to master a sciencey field, but i often find myself in the world between China and America, probably because of my background. but i find myself to be one of the very few people who understands the chinese perspective of things but able to communicate this in english

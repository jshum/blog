	future of cs: ontologies
    	the future of cs<br />great overview of the philosophy of cs behind the waves of big companies we have seen. <br /><a href="http://nplusonemag.com/the-stupidity-of-computers">http://nplusonemag.com/the-stupidity-of-computers</a><p /> on how computers reaffirm the categories we have made:<br />&#39;So the humans decided on the categories and assigned the data to the individual categories—then told the computers to confirm their judgments. Naturally the computers obliged. &#39;<p />the impossibility of smart ai, or context understanding ai. too much meaning to understand<br />instead, try to categorize as much as possible without understanding the meaning of anything<br /> &#39;This will not yield intelligence per se, but computers will be able to analyze the basic physical stuff of the world just as they currently analyze the basic informational stuff of the web.&#39;<p />so the future is of computers towards us and us towards computers<br />&#39;First, <em>we will bring ourselves to computers</em>. The small- and large-scale convenience and efficiency of storing more and more parts of our lives online will increase the hold that formal ontologies have on us.&#39;<p />&#39;Second, <em>we will bring computers to us</em>, not semantically but physically. Computers will be able to interface more and more directly with the real world. As people have repeatedly learned, with great frustration, the task of manually ordering the world into a semantically meaningful format is too huge and imprecise a task—too imprecise for computers and too huge for humans.&#39;<br />&#39;processing power increases and the size and cost of computers shrink to the point of microscopic disposability, they can be embedded into everything: roads, paper, clothing, skin, organs, medicines, food. From that will come a way forward.&#39;<p />another possibility is for computing to be so ubiquitous than &#39;smart&#39; behavior emerges. &#39;behave intelligently in an <em>emergent fashion</em> becomes remotely plausible&#39;<p /> but we are still stuck with the stupidity of the computer &#39;The bad news is that, because computers cannot come to us and meet us in our world, we must continue to adjust our world and bring ourselves to them. We will define and regiment our lives, including our social lives and our perceptions of our selves, in ways that are conducive to what a computer can “understand.” Their dumbness will become ours. &#39;<p />post script<br /><a href="http://griffsgraphs.com/2012/07/03/graphing-every-idea-in-history/">http://griffsgraphs.com/2012/07/03/graphing-every-idea-in-history/</a><br /> <a href="http://drunks-and-lampposts.com/2012/06/13/graphing-the-history-of-philosophy/">http://drunks-and-lampposts.com/2012/06/13/graphing-the-history-of-philosophy/</a><br />these are obvous examples of humans applying their ontology.

    weird dream last night<br />all of the incoming students were living in a big big house, like a dormitory<br />but it was more like a ski chalet<br />i was there early<p />participated in some thing involved with waves and water<br /> but i dropped off before the end.<br />climbed on the shore<br />and two monks, one male and one female, the male was young but wise. a young dhalai lhama.<br />the female told me she thought i might be in danger<br />but the male say that it was going to be fine<p /> then, i found the girl i liked, a<br />was walking around with her.<br />i asked if she wanted to walk around the park. she said no probably worrying i was going to try to initiate something too intimate<br />but she sat down on some steps <br /> and she held my hand.<br />we kept walking, started heading back towards someone<p />she saw a friend at the entrance of the chalet<br />talked very excitedly.<br />we were walking back towards her room when she suddenly said she had to return sth to a friend.<br /> she told me to wait because she was going to be back in a few seconds.<br />she rushed out into the snow and then suddenly all these other people came into the waiting room.<br />i was pushed back and couldn&#39;t see very well.<br /> i didn&#39;t see her again and i got really worried<br />i started following girls i thought were her before i realized it wasn&#39;t<p />and then i walked towards the rooms upstairs<br />i had been to her room once but forgot where it was exactly<br /> i kept walking around and saw other people <br />then, i finally gave up and went back to sleep.<p />i woke up in my suite, galen had come back, john as well, as well as jimmy.<p />there were other random parts like having breakfast in a weird cafeteria which only sold fried stuff<br /> anant was happily munching on his fried chicken. <br />even mom had to have some fried chicken cuz she was so hungry.

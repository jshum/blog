	summer in providence
    	providence summers have been surprisingly awful.<br />below is sort of my understanding of my house and my room and heat after a week of living here:<br /><ol><li>heat really blows, saps the energy and concentration out of you. you wake up in sweat, restless, among other things</li> <li>our house has relatively poor ventilation. probably because there are houses on the two sides of it, the only place with good ventilation is the front side of the house. and the most ventilated room in the house is the kitchen. with four windows facing the front of the house.<br /> </li><li>the heat really does rise to the top of the house. since my room is on the top floor, it really boils.</li><li>for the full day experiment i carried out, it is bearable from morning even until 2pm.</li><li>as soon as the sun goes onto the west side, and my window faces the west, the room gets unbearably hot.</li> <li>it is still unbearably hot in the room now, even though it is 9:30pm.</li><li>the trick is to get the heat out of the room, which i&#39;ve been told and managed to do more successfully by having the fan blow from the window. cool air from outside gets sucked in. as soon it is dark out, place the fan in the window.</li> <li>then it slowly cools down during the night. <br /></li><li>bathroom may also be another reason. no windows, so hot air is trapped inside and my room is right next to the bathroom.<br /></li><li>buy a better fan or get used to working in the kitchen is the only good solution.</li> </ol><p>schedule i propose for myself and which i hope i follow<br /></p><ol><li>best way is probably to sleep from 11p/12a-7a/8a or something. probably depends on how hot it is at night in my room. <br /></li><li>work from home for probably 1 or 2 hours.<br /> </li><li>go to work. do allÂ  probably from 9a-7p/10a-8p to avoid the heat</li><li>go out for dinner or eat at home</li><li>chill at home. read hopefully.<br /></li></ol>

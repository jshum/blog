    	president<br />good morning and my name is xxxxxxxxxx. every year, candidates make promises, make promises to listen, to make better events, and to serve. however, these promises are often unrealistic or vague. how we one person expect to listen to the whole upper school student body or serve every each one of them? today, i wil not make these promises or tell you what i will do. i will tell you what i have. i have a passion for this schoooll i&#39;ve been here since reception, back then when i was EVEN tinier. but i&#39;ve seen how the school has changed, from being a second-rate school to a top tier school. but i&#39;m more concerned in the change of us, the students. i have a vision for our school, to make the students proud when they say their name. i want us to be able to at any person and beam with pride when we wave our maple leafs insignias. and that is my vision.<br /> Â <br />public relations<br />good morning and my name is tracie. every year, candidates make promises, make promises to listen, to make better events, and to serve. however, these promises are often unrealistic or vague. how we one person expect to listen to the whole upper school student body or serve every each one of them? today, i wil not make these promises or tell you what i will do. i will tell you what i have. i have a passion for this schoooll i&#39;ve been here since reception, back then when i was EVEN tinier.i&#39;ve walked through every corridor while playing hide and seek, seen the school in every possible shade of light. my passion is what will drive me to stay way past my bedtime and work for the school community. my passion is what will make me work past differences and produce results. i may be short but i stand proud and tall for my love of this school: C-D-N-I-S. therefore, please put a tick beside the person who not makes the most promises but loves the school the most to fulfill those promises.

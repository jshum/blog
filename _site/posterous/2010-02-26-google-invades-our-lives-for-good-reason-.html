	Google invades Our Lives (for good reason)

<div><a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/02/ff_google_algorithm/all/1"></a>a few years back. people started getting scared of google because of its enormous presence on the internet, the new domain of human beings where we seem to create an electronic version of ourselves for the world to see.</div>
<p />
<div>we say google is scary and invading our privacy. it is true. every single google search you run up is written onto their hard drives but not so that they can create profiles on us and rule the world (maybe to a certain extent, not so extreme though since google's motto is "don't be evil". lol). they're gathering data to improve google search. the search function as a technology has not been stagnant. if you know a bit about web history, google became famous because of pagerank. but other things too have improved too, the 400 minor updates they've carried out to make search better and better</div>

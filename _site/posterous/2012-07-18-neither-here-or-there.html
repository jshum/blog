	neither here or there
    	<p>i think i am different. i cared. and perhaps that what casued problems. because being neither here or there never works. it's either physical or serious. being in the middle just ends up misleading people with fictional hopes and intentions. being physical, you can blame hormones. being serious, you have to blame yourself. but in the middle, the other is at fault.</p>
<p>perhaps that's what nice guys finish last means. they put others before themselves so their own wishes are never fulfilled. in situations neither here or there, they still care about the other's emotions, but yet unable to repress the physical attraction either. so they end up misleading with words and body language they can't control. nice guys force emotional investment but maybe that's the worst heartbreak, not the ones found waking in a stranger's bed. that's shame but heartbreak is pain. it's much worse to be considered the romantic poet who has physical needs than the player who has emotions.</p>
<p>being a heartless stud maybe easier. it just requires an obsession with getting ripped and your own physical gratification. but that's the game studs want to play. they want to convince you that being the nice guy will always in you being last. but it's that stupid hope you have to keep on to i suppose, like all the wongfu videos that i have seen, yet another self-deceiving thing to keep us going. i am different.</p>

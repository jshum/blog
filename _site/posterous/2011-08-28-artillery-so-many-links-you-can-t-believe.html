    	so here's an interesting article about Dan Savage's view on infidelity. <br />his theory is that we should try our hand on non-monogamy. since human <br />beings (mostly men) have different sexual urges than their partners, <br />their partners should allow them to pursue those desires, maybe it <br />would be for the better. <br />i'm a realist. and looking at the current gossip world of sex scandals <br />being uncovered one after another, i must say there is some truth to <br />what he says. <br />and instead of outright saying all these men are bastards, maybe we <br />should just lower our standards and instead think of ways to avoid <br />them. <br />so there's a thought. but important thing. failing at monogamy is not <br />succeeding at non-monogamy. <br /><a

apparently, glucose deprivation changes brain activity. it encourages <br />more short-term thinking and slows down parts of the brain related to <br />long-term planning/thinking <br />so rule is to minimize our loss in willpower, keep a routine, schedule <br />so that we have more willpower to devote to other things. <br /><a

about a search for our true self. <br />the philosophical point of view is that our true self is the one <br />defined by our rational thought. <br />the humanist point of view is that our true self is the one that <br />succumbs to our unspeakable desires and irks. <br />i don't quite know what the conclusion is. if you know, please tell me. <br /><a

<br />an article on the new online dating scene, the rise to fortunes of <br />match.com eharmony.com chemistry.com okcupid.com <br />interesting article containing anecdotes, science: another example of <br />why newyorker is maybe the premier publication in the english-speaking <br />world, stuff less boring than the american scholar but more <br />well-written and thought-provoking than new york times. <br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/07/04/110704fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=all">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/07/04/110704fa_fact_paumgarten?curren...</a> <p /> my new 3-minute interest in biophysics/biomathematics starts from this article <br /><a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2011/04/viruses-essay-pattern">http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2011/04/viruses-essay-pattern</a> <p /> similar to ideas to the book, stumbling on happiness. it really is a good read. <br /><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2300558/pagenum/all/">http://www.slate.com/id/2300558/pagenum/all/</a> <p /> something on the karen owens incident. the atlantic argues that karen <br />owen does not represent a high in feminism but rather a low. <br /><a

on a macro investor and the company he has <br />built: bridgewater. <br /><a

central to the renaissance mindset shift. the <br />lucretius pursuit of happiness. one line i do really like though from <br />this article, which echoes the chinese book i've been reading. 語錄 － <br />周國平 <br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/08/110808fa_fact_greenblatt">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/08/110808fa_fact_greenblatt</a> <p /> a for interest article on how math was used to stitch together a super <br />high resolution picture of an art. <br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/11/050411fa_fact">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/11/050411fa_fact</a> <p /> i've joked about amy chua a lot, saying my mom is a lot like her. well <br />the following are three articles that i think are representative of <br />the asian-american case <br />1) http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/04/the-ivy-delusion/8397/?single_page=true <br />asian mothers, i.e. amy chua, are willing to give up their child's <br />childhood to get into a elite college. and western mothers don't agree <br />because of psychological reasons and what not. the truth is that <br />western mothers know that asians are taking the spots of their own <br />kids. <p /> 2) http://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/ <br />asian kids get into elite colleges. they have the highest median <br />salary of any ethnicity. but they don't rise to the top. at heart, we <br />are still afraid. <p /> 3) http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904233404576462042857022426.html <br />the reality holds that, maybe because of some underlying racism, or <br />simply a problem with the asian mentality, we never rise to the top. <p /> 4) http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/04/sympathy-for-the-tiger-moms/8399/ <br />a sort of recap on this asian-american life. we have our highs when we <br />are young, but in our 40's we are all fallen prodigies, who have given <br />up for other things. in the end, she makes a good point. we may be <br />prodigies now, but "in a century, no one will be humming us." i think <br />i should too just do something i like, lead a life i like, so that we <br />may not have success, but we have content. <p /> article about porn. haven't finished it yet because it wasn't as good <br />as i expected it to be. <br /><a

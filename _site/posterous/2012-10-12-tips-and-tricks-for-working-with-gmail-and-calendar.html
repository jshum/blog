    i love gmail.<br />i am an unabashed lover of gmail.<br />as you get older and have increasing responsibilities and start to get email from a lot of different people, you start getting lots of email (many of them from mailing list) which seriously clutters your mailbox.<p /> first create a filter for all the mail you get from mailing lists.<br />generously apply labels and choose colors for them (which for me at least just serves as a visual guide to how many of my new emails are from various lists)<br /> most emails have various levels of priority, a lot of email which you can defer processing of should skip the inbox in your filter settings<p />so now you have all these labels labelling mail that you routinely expect to receive and could defer processing of.<br /> enable the multiple inbox lab, and in inbox 1, do -label:labelYouDontWantToSee for all the labels you don&#39;t to see.<br />remember to include -label:sent -label:trash -label:chat -label:draft here label:inbox in this line<br /> so now, you have a list of all &quot;important&quot; emails that only you receive.<br />a reminder that keyboard shortcuts do not work here, which is a bummer.<p />because of how popular gmail is, many different automation services support it.<br /> i really hate using greader as a separate thing but i know many who do.<br />i use ifttt to send me rss posts and then i label them to skip the inbox, which I then can read later.<p />finally, please add all the people you regularly talk to or will talk to at some point in your gchat list. why send an email when you can understand each other better, skip the formalities and do it over gchat. do it.<p /> to do list<br />i&#39;ve toyed with many different to do list (todoist, checkvist, remember the milk. the one i&#39;ve had most success with is checkvist) over the years but having to open another window just isn&#39;t as good as having it within the same window. gtask isn&#39;t perfect but it serves the purpose. it&#39;s integration with google calendar also makes it the obvious choice if you like to list most of your things on gcal.<br /> but my pet peeve with gtask is that there&#39;s no good way to archive things except delete them. the jerry springer method requires you to receive motivation from having not broken your streak. imagine how nice it would be to be able to see all these check marks on your calendar by tagging each task with a date.

	on china.
    	thoughts on china<p />china politically<br />some highlights i remember from a dinner with a friend in the workforce<p />平民知道官贪，官也知道平民知道他们贪，但是官就是说自己没贪<br />villagers know that officials are corrupt, and officials know that villagers know that they are corrupt, but they still say &quot;we are not corrupt&quot;<p /> 穷惯了，不想再穷下去<br />they&#39;re used to being poor. they don&#39;t want to be poor anymore<p />中国人对奢shi品的态度跟外国人不一样<br />chinese have a different attitude towards luxury brands<p />每一层都是烂的<br />every tier of china is broken<p /> 所有人都只是在混日子<br />everyone is living a day at a time.<p />3到8年一定有动荡<br />there will be significant turmoil in 3-8 years<p />highlights from a conversation with a chinese grad student studying in the states<br />china science<p /> Q: what do you think of the research quality in china?<br />chinese researchers focus more on the quantity of their papers, as opposed to quality of their papers.<br />so instead of perhaps working on a harder topic on a longer period of time, they would instead publish numerous papers whose quality may not be their personal best.<p /> Q: do you think the training from USA is better or different.<br />USA training forces the student to be more academically independent, able to fill in the blanks after given a topic, while chinese-trained ones cannot<p /> Q: why so many kids enter the chinese science-related majors (STEM fields)&nbsp; but i don&#39;t quite seem to see a lot of successful examples of them rising to the top? <p />a lot of people who shouldn&#39;t and don&#39;t want to be there ARE there<br /> a lot of chinese attitudes don&#39;t really have a mature attitude towards finding a job. so it suddenly dawns about them when they are a senior that they need to find a job. a portion of the students deal with this by going for a PhD and postpone the pressure of finding a job. thus, not a lot of them need the training<p /> the chinese mentality also have a twisted attitude towards degrees. the higher the better, resulting in a lot of wasted time doing something they will never need.<p />the best still go abroad. so when they return, they still count as returnees regardless of the length of the stay <br /> out of 100 who go abroad for PhDs, maybe 50 to come back, of those, maybe 25 will want to become professors.for the younger generation, almost all of them have abroad experience, be it getting their PhD in the states, or just a few years of exchange.<p /> Q: so will it improve?<br />china research was very behind when it started but is catching up. just the quantity itself is staggering. over half of the papers i come across in my work were written by chinese. there is some change, for example: forcing engineers to finish their masters in 2 years as opposed to 3 years so that they have to go join the work force.<p /> foreigners perspective on china<br />couple clothes and victory signs when taking pictures are ridiculous<p />my thoughts:<br />in general, i think more and more people or at least i am realizing that it is more difficult to enter the chinese market than i thought. they have their own mentality which i will never fully be step into. when events happen and explanations are provided, i can understand how and why it would happen but i would never be able to act in that way. they have their own culture and habits that are very difficult to change.

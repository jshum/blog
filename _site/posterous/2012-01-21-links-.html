If you’re going to devote the best years of your life to your work, have enough love for yourself and the world around you to work on something that matters to you deeply. Something that’s beating out of your chest and compels you to throw yourself at it completely. No one knows whether you and your teammates will realize your audacious visions, but in order to do great things, we must attempt great things.&quot;</div> <p /><div><a href="http://www.slashgear.com/the-problem-with-tech-and-teaching-20210226/" target="_blank">http://www.slashgear.com/the-problem-with-tech-and-teaching-20210226/</a></div><div>improving education needs to start with the people.</div>

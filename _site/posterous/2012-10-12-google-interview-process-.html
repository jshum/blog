	google interview process.
    	Google interviews:<br />resources from the internet. for me now and for me in the future:<br />TYPES OF QUESTIONS: <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-should-I-expect-in-a-Product-Manager-interview-at-Google-and-how-should-I-prepare">http://www.quora.com/What-should-I-expect-in-a-Product-Manager-interview-at-Google-and-how-should-I-prepare</a><br /> LIST OF QUESTIONS: <a href="http://www.impactinterview.com/2009/10/140-google-interview-questions/">http://www.impactinterview.com/2009/10/140-google-interview-questions/</a><br />HIRING PROCESS: <a href="http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2010/09/how-to-get-a-job-at-google-interview-questions-hiring-process.html">http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2010/09/how-to-get-a-job-at-google-interview-questions-hiring-process.html</a><br /> EXAMPLE OF THE PROCESS: <a href="http://almossawi.mit.edu/2011/10/interviewing-at-google/">http://almossawi.mit.edu/2011/10/interviewing-at-google/</a><p />There are 8 balls. Seven of them weigh the same, but one is heavier. Using a balance scale, how do you find the heavier ball with just two weighings?<p />The traditional approach would be to do it as such<br />1) four balls vs four balls<br />2) two balls vs two balls<br />3) one ball vs one ball<br />This is finding out certainly with three.<p />perhaps you could do<br /> 1) two balls vs two balls<br />2a) if 1 showed a difference, then one ball vs ball for balls on heavier side.<br />2b) but if 1 shows no difference, then you have to repeat 1 and 2a) for the other four balls.<br />This is finding out with 1/2 probability using two.<br /> Â <br />but you can actually find out certainly with two.<br />1) three balls vs three balls<br />2a) if 1 shows no difference, then do one ball vs one ball for the remaining two<br />2b) if 1 shows a difference, take balls from heavier side and then do one ball vs one ball for two of them.<br /> 3b) you know which one if 2b shows difference. even if 2b) doesn&#39;t show difference, you are certain it must be the remaining one.

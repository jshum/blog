Bill gates strong belief in the need for a pc, obviously because he caused it.<p /> but furthermore, you can see two different styles of working.<br />bill gates is a big worldly person. he&#39;s thinking about impact, legacy. he wants his next crowning achievement to be his philanthropy work. &quot;education. not a technology thing but a institutional thing.&quot; he&#39;s a people person. his best advice was &quot;being at the forefront, seeing new things, making people work together&quot;<br /> compared to, steve jobs who is a creator, who said multiple times the excitement is what makes him go to work everyday. he loves his work. best advice &quot;passion, you need the passion to persevere through the hardwork. be a good talent scouter&quot;<p /> YP: go to the fastest industry<br />from the interview, probably should think about going into the fastest growing consumer product.

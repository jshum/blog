    	something about posts. they&#39;re like snapshots but truth, it&#39;s a long roll of paper coming out from a fax. never stops<div>even when nothing is being typed, it doesn&#39;t mean nothing is happening </div><p /> <div>i think the big picture is always important.</div><div>not only for life, which i mentioned a few posts back, about getting perspective on college life. </div><div>but i realize it also applies to knowledge, to learning.</div> <p /><div>i took my applied math professor&#39;s advice to heart.</div><div>she told me that knowledge compresses.</div><div>and it&#39;s true if you find the general theme, make the connections.</div><div>the idea is you always need to think about the big picture to connect things, to tie everything together, so it&#39;s know one thing instead of many.</div> <p /><div>synthesizing knowledge.</div><div>i did that for linear algebra today and it felt great, being to synthesize everything onto a sheet of paper.</div><div>but i also prefer it not being notes.</div><p /><div>notes are serial, sequential.</div><div>chronological is the most used way to rmb sth but it doesn&#39;t provide the most insight at all i would say.</div><div>but the brain is really like a network, a network of nodes to send out electronic signals.</div> <div>imagine memory being inside a node, if you make a connection, you build a link. the more times you make that connection, the stronger that link is.</div><div>in the same way, i feel like notes should be like that, mindmaps, network of connections.</div> <p /><div>someone posted about scott young and his project of learning 4 yrs worth of college material in a year.</div><div>i was wondering about that this morning.</div><div>i guess it&#39;s sort of frustrating that someone is learning what i&#39;m struggling with in a week and did fine on the MIT exam.....</div> <div>no, i&#39;m really frustrated.</div><p /><div>instead of blaming college and the scam it really is which we all could and this guy does:</div><div><a href="http://marcanthonyrosa.com/college-the-biggest-scam-well-ever-buy" target="_blank">http://marcanthonyrosa.com/college-the-biggest-scam-well-ever-buy</a></div> <p /><div>i think it&#39;s a problem on my part.</div><div>i need to learn to learn.</div><div>i thought i learnt how to did that in high school.</div><div>but i guess i didn&#39;t. i need to practice learning.</div> <p /><div>science should be one of those easily condensible subjects because all equations can be derived from axioms.</div><div>math too, but there&#39;s intuition leading you anywhere.</div><p /><div> lots of people make reasons why we don&#39;t need to remember what we don&#39;t need.</div><div>because it&#39;s wasting brain space or whatever.</div><div>but again, it&#39;s also one of those things that separates an informed and uninformed person (educated would be too harsh)</div> <div>you can&#39;t say you forgot math.</div><div>in the same way, i can&#39;t say i forgot e&amp;m. i shouldn&#39;t say expected but you should rmb the gist of it after you learn it not cram and forget.</div><div><a href="http://cramster.com" target="_blank">cramster.com</a> &lt;---hmmm.</div> <div>it&#39;s one of those things that are nice to talk about but i can never do.</div><p /><div>starting next semester, let&#39;s try. synthesize knowledge every week. that&#39;s what homeworks should be but this semester, i definitely viewed e&amp;m homework definitely was more a chore than a learning experience.</div> <div>if i approached it differently, maybe it would be better but i guess i&#39;ll never find out.</div><p /><div>i also am thinking of writing a big picture essay for myself. </div><div>so i hope to write sth about themes in my life. a seminal essay for a 19 yr old boy. lol</div>

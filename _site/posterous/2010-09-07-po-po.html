	PO PO
    	the person i will miss most is my grandma.<p />i&#39;m just worried that nobody will visit her or willing to talk with her on the phone<br />i&#39;m quite the hypocrite in saying it because i always skip out on these duties myself.<p /> looking at her old photos, she was really pretty.<br />and looking at her now, it&#39;s really amazing how she can still live up to that age with a continuing desire to learn.

	we are.
    	we are human and we don&#39;t make perfect decisions.<br />but if by a stroke of luck that those imperfect decisions become ingenious ones because of an unexpected change in circumstance. <br />be it not that we are emboldened to act rashly because of our luck or indecisively because of our worries. <br />this is rhetoric, stylistic in its arrangement of words<br />but ambivalent in the point it is trying to make.Â <div>yet, we all fall deeply in love with rhetoric, swept off our feet by its beauty.<br /></div>

	economics, politics and culture
    	why is economics and politics so popular?<br />or is it only in this industry?<p />experience is important with economics and politics<br />quite situation dependent.<br />business is all about knowing the knooks and cranies<br /> straight business doesn&#39;t occur<br />business occurs given relationships, buildup of trust that requires time, understanding<p />is it just the industry you&#39;re in<br />i guess if you&#39;re in the finance related sector, discussions of gov policies, day to day index performances are integral to your job<p /> is culture more encompassing than economics/politics<br />mentioning of culture seems to be as manifestations of cultures, songs, shows, there&#39;s no direct critique or mention of it.<br />but even taxi-drivers consistently talk about politics and economics likes it&#39;s their main job.

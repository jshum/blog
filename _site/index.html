	    <p>Unfortunate that after four years, we&#8217;re back into this rat race agian, trying to cram all of our four years of college courses and summer internships into a page work of information.</p>

<p>We get feed into a database and then a computer returns if our cv contains certain keywords that the employer uses.</p>

<p>CV classification software engineers:</p>

<ul>
<li>strong skillset</li>

<li>relevant set of experiences. course project or otherwise</li>
</ul>

<p>product manager * experience working with users or leading projects</p>

<p>data scientist</p>

<ul>
<li>strong math background</li>

<li>working with large datasets and complex algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>Pepole have told me that you should put more about your experiences than your courses. It seems somewhat unintuitive that courses that you spend 9 months out of a year on are less important than the 3 months you spend as a part time summer emloyee. I suppose that&#8217;s because recruiters recruit from the same school, or graduates from similar schools, which means students the same classes more or less. So they encode all that coursework into a GPA and a very small list of really cool courses which you have taken, which will be relevant to the company.</p>

<p>What differentiates you from the next person is your summer experiences and the projects you do on your own time. Courses are a given. Everything else is what differentiates you.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the thing: People who get good jobs will automatically assume they have good CV&#8217;s. That&#8217;s not true. In fact, people who get good jobs could have very shitty CV&#8217;s but really ace their interview.</p>

<p>A CV also is a fit. When they return emails, they always say if your resume is a fit. That&#8217;s where the keywords come in. For everything in life, it&#8217;s all about a fit.</p>

    <p>This thanksgiving, I elected to spend it in Washington DC with my dear friend Ian. I also managed to see JL the morning I left DC which was really unexpected and extremely nice.</p>

<p>When you reach an age like 20, you realize that the life you want to live is getting more and more different from your friends.</p>

<p>We need to start making decisions for ourselves now. There are certain nuances in situations that you just have to decide what the right thing to do is instead of hoping your friend has the right advice.</p>

<p>But then, thats what friends are right? People who understand you enough, your background, your personality, that they can give you the options to consider.</p>

<p>Although friends are different peop,e you can still treat their lives as some kind of model for you to follow.</p>

    <p>I want you to think for a moment about the guarantees you live for granted.</p>

<p>We all live under the illusion of guarantee that tomorrow we will wake up and the world will be mostly the same. Our lives, our health will mostly be the same as they were yesterday.</p>

<p>This is the guarantee we take for granted. But this is the guarantee we need so that we can plan our lives, so that we can make plans for tomorrow and not fear that they won&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s always some danger in living. There&#8217;s always the 0.0001% that a bullet is going to fly through the window and kill you, but our brains ignores these so we can live some life.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s two things to recognnize here: One is that paranoia stems from the inability to single out those marginal probabilities.</p>

<p>And the second is what happens when we actually wake up and find ourselves in the universe of that 0.0001%, that we have been diagnosed with terminal cancer, that we were just in a car crash and will be quadraplegic for the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>We lose all sense of direction, paralyzed not by fear, but simply by not knowing what to do, our lives being completely disrupted and overturned.</p>

<p>(Humans are paralyzed by having too many choices. That&#8217;s why we always to take little steps, to reduce the number of choices. Part of learning and maturing is knowing how to become better and better at this, streamlining decisions, but of course by sacrificing creativity)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that humans live before they think about why they live the way they do. This is due to evolution, the man who made sure he came up with a reason why he should hunt before he did died way more often than the man who just hunted and had food to survive.</p>

<p>So we do, we must live today and the next day, by assuming that tomorrow will be normal.</p>

    <p>Think about your daily routine for a moment. Think about how many things we take for granted. I&#8217;m not trying to say anybody is spoilt. I&#8217;m just trying to make you think about some of the consequences.</p>

<p>The whole point of science is that if we can extract some pattern from a random series of data points. And society utilizes this to reduce the amount of randomness in our lives.</p>

<p>Think about lives at every pont of civilization. When we were hunters, we couldn&#8217;t take for granted we would have good the next day and we would be alive the next day. So we figured out the pattern of growing crops and invented farming. When we were farming, we couldn&#8217;t take for granted growing food over the winter, so we figured out the pattern of processing food so it would stay good. We invited food silos and curing and pickling. Think about the Middle Ages, the type of things that people couldn&#8217;t take for granted: a child will survive until chilhood, a mother won&#8217;t die from childbirth. Slowly, we patterned everything. We made them into rules, laws, protocols, bodies of study.</p>

<p>So today we live in a world under the illusion of guarantee of enough food, clean water, medical treatment, liberty, freedom of speech. But waking up one day and not having these guarantees.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s war, that&#8217;s disease. How do you plan your life anymore if you don&#8217;t kow what happens.</p>

<p>The point is that our lives are a lot more regimented than what human life started with. This pattern is going to keep going. We&#8217;re going to keep pattern matching. We&#8217;ve done a lot of work in understanding the physical world in the past few centuries. This century is going to be dominated by understanding what happens inside our heads, our bodies, our genes, understand why we behave the way we do, determining a pattern for human behavior.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a scary thought that we, our behavior, are all just going to become predictable data points, but that&#8217;s what science is about.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>Just want to do a shout out to my friends Jayson and Hans who are doing some awesome work with <a href='http://www.medinternational-us.org/'>Med International</a>. They are some of the most thoughtful and intelligent people I know. They are trying to change the improve Zanzibar&#8217;s health system by approaching in a very systematic and technical way and not just blindly matching needs. Give them some of your love as well.</p>

<p>Had dinner with Hans last night where we had a really good conversation so I wanted to crudely paraphrase some things he said.</p>

<ol>
<li>Back in agricultural society, land owners need workders. So they pay them just enough to keep them alive. That was the extent of doing good.</li>

<li>During the industrial revolution, we had a complete breakdown of this. So there was a legislative pushback. Passed laws to limit the age of workers, health laws.</li>
</ol>

<p>History of doing good</p>

<ol>
<li>Doing good was originally the complete responsibility of the state.</li>

<li>However, it turns out that we need something more than that. So NGO&#8217;s popped up and started doing good</li>

<li>At some point, some people realized that they didn&#8217;t have to rely on the state anymore. They could start their own businesses to do good as well.</li>

<li>Finally, we have impact investment where we have the emergence of traditional businesses being forced to examine their own social outcomes</li>
</ol>

<p>Another interesting anecdote he gave me was about the Clinton Foundation and about Ashoka fellows.</p>

<p>During the 90&#8217;s, HIV anti-viral drugs were exorbitantly priced. So the clinton foundation brought together all the developing countries who had a huge depend for these drugs into a pact and made the pharmaceutical companies slash their prices in exchange for the promised demand from all of these countries. It was a huge success but they received criticism for applying a free-market solution to a social problem. They basically said we know that but we&#8217;re not trying to force-fit every problem with a free-market solution.</p>

<p>Secondly Ashoka fellows are apparently like the Morgan Stanley performers in the social entrepreneurship world. And the study on them is that they are just basically high preforming entrepreneurs who would have been successful in any field. They are relentlessly resourceful.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a question I have: Can all social problems be solved by free-market solutions? Doesn&#8217;t the notion of doing good and giving something to everybody fundamentally contradict with the notion of free market capitalism?</p>

<p>In the ideal world, rebalancing should be built into the system, but it isn&#8217;t. So just by acknolwedging we need to make the effort of redistributing, you&#8217;re saying the system hasn&#8217;t done its job. But then, do you still do something about it?</p>

    <p>Two weeks ago, I was feeling pretty tired from work, pretty lonely from it. I was pretty lost in terms of the future. I was feeling that I was underappreciated, that despite working so hard, people weren&#8217;t recognizing my skills. I was feeling afraid, afraid that I would end up doing some unfulfilling job that had no purpose. I didn&#8217;t know where I was going. I called my parents and talked to them. And the best thing is when they come through. My dad provided some out of the blue advice that made me feel a lot better.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a part of it which I quickly jotted down after hanging up the phone. Hopefully, it helps you as well:</p>

<p>The entry point into any career is mostly an accident You can&#8217;t really choose Your entry point is a combination of an industry and an opportunity</p>

<p>What you can decide though are the things you like doing. Your college degree, your interests are a reflection on who you have become and who you want to be. But what your career is mostly an accident</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you have to think about your strengths, your bargaining chip. You can challenge your weaknesses but what are people going to pay you to do.</p>

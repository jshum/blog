  <a href="/2012/12/15/programmer-vs-computer-scientist"><h2>Guide on how to spend your time.</h2></a>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>I&#8217;ve been working with Spencer on our programming languages final project for over two months now. The project has required a lot of time, forcing me to cut back on a lot of my other activities. I now find myself just casually dedicating hours a day to this giant giant project. It got me thinking about my time, and what it meant to me and how I wanted to spend it, particularly in computer science.</p>

<p>To put it more concretely, you can think of it as the difference between a programmer and a computer scientist.</p>

<p>NOTE: For the CS majors who are reading this, I know these two constructs are very similar and there is a lot of if not complete overlap. I&#8217;m using the definitions of the terms in their most extreme cases for the purpose of illustrating the argument.</p>

<p>A programmer&#8217;s project comes with a spec and a deadline. The programmer&#8217;s job is to write code that behaves as specified in the spec by that certain deadline.</p>

<p>A computer scientist&#8217;s project comes with a question and the objective is to come up with a general and robust model/system that correctly generates different types of behavior. It might require a lot of different approaches and implementations before the right one is found because of the many factors to weigh each time. There&#8217;s no concern about time constraints because the purpose is to get the best model possible.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of &#8216;ethical&#8217; questions that come up here. Programmers should take shortcuts to finish their task as long as it behaves as the spec tells it to. Programmers worry a lot less about correctness than about its superficial behavior. Everything could explode any moment internally but if it looked ok to the world, it&#8217;s ok.</p>

<p>But programming languages is one of the those things that ISN&#8217;T like that. It&#8217;s about correctness. It&#8217;s about the general case for all situations. Prior to this moment in my cs career, I&#8217;ve also treated myself as a programmer. I have this project/homework and I have to finish it by this deadline. Do it. And what I&#8217;ve realized and my partner has enforced me to do in the right way. That&#8217;s the explanation of why so much of my time has been dedicated to this project but on the flip side, I&#8217;ve learnt so much.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to say doing it in the computer sciencetist doesn&#8217;t have problems. When given this giant insurmountable problem, it&#8217;s very difficult to find the courage to tackle it. A programmer will discretize a task into managable pieces which makes you feel that you can take it on. The computer scientist way also is not effective. There&#8217;s a lot of time and effort and probably very little to show for it.</p>

<p>This actually has a lot of larger implications. We can frame this in the larger question of life.</p>

<p>Take some time to look at the two following videos: I watched both of these last night. The Tim Ferriss one on purpose, and the Stephen Fry one by accident.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://fora.tv/2011/09/14/Tim_Ferriss_Accelerated_Learning_in_Accelerated_Times'>Exhibit 1: Tim Ferriss</a> He is someone whom I would consider the most extreme programmer type. (His talk is from 7:00-50:00)</li>

<li><a href='http://bigthink.com/ideas/17862'>Exhibit 2: Stephen Fry</a> is the computer scientist. (It&#8217;s a long interview. The transcript is also there. Pick and choose. I think the important ones are &#8216;what do you believe in&#8217;)</li>
</ul>

<p>On one spectrum, Tim Ferriss talks about minimal effective units. He wants to show you can be better than the crowd even with minimal effort. Basically, he&#8217;s applying the laws of marginal return and Pareto principle. Find the 20% that gives you the 80% and stop as soon as you reach that. Don&#8217;t do anymore or any less.</p>

<p>On the other spectrum, you have Stephen Fry, the poet/scientist, the one drowning in hiw own thoughts and philosophy. He spends relentless energy and effort attacking the same problem, revisiting it again and again, beating it to utter death, but the thing that keeps him on is his utter love for it.</p>

<p>The programmer always looks better on paper simply because he&#8217;s done a lot. The comptuer scientist doesn&#8217;t look good on paper but if you ask him about things on the one problem he has spend inordiante amounts of time on, you will be completely be blown away.</p>

<p>I think this question is better framed in a context proposed by my mentor:</p>

<p>You should be at least somewhat decent at everything, but be completely breathtaking at one thing. I think that&#8217;s what Tim Ferriss is sort of advocating. He doesn&#8217;t claim that you will become a fluent speaker in 4 weeks, but he promises you to become a functional speaker. He is teaching you the way to be efficient with your time so that you can spend that extra amount of time on the ONE THING you absolutely love. If you take both people&#8217;s ideas and run with them, it&#8217;s really quite nice. You&#8217;ll be good enough at a lot of things with very minimal effort but you&#8217;ll be a boss at that one thing you love.</p>

<p>And I think that&#8217;s the more important debate to have. What is the one thing you want to be a computer scientist at? and how do you reduce your effort in every other domain but still achieve respectable results?</p>

  <a href="/2012/12/08/remarks"><h2>remarks at the end of the semester</h2></a>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>We&#8217;re at the end of another semester already. Handed in my 29th problem set of the semester earlier today. The last one is due on Friday.</p>

<p>Just a number of observations I&#8217;ve made this semester:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve worked extremely hard this semester</li>

<li>This semester, my life has mostly consisted of me finishing problem sets and sleeping.</li>
</ul>

<p>People have commented on it. Believe it or not, it has been going on in the back of my head this whole semester. Why I&#8217;m working so hard? Here&#8217;s sort of what I&#8217;ve got now.</p>

<p>The very first question is why do? why do anything? We don&#8217;t have to at all, infact. By and large, in most of today&#8217;s societies, there is enough of a safety net to keep us alive. But the instrinsic motivation to do things exists in us because it is evolutionarily advantageous. We are alive because all of our ancestors are the ones who chose to go out and find food, to eat, to live and to survive. We are the descendants of the people of the people who wanted to live the most. Of anything, the trait to do the things needed to surivive get more and more reinforced every generation.</p>

<p>And then comes the question of purpose, right? What is the purpose of it all? None really if you ask me. But at the same time consider this, humans are the only living species who try to reason our why they are alive. For all the universe cares (if it cared at all), we are just more particles, we don&#8217;t behave deterministically. We just do things.</p>

<p>First you have to believe. But if you accept both things above and still are wondering for a reason, here&#8217;s another one.Because you are in the position to do so. For what you are about to do, thinking about doing, you are in a position to do it. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9thJm7_H68'>This</a> Will Smith interview sums up this positive gungho attitude on life pretty nicely.</p>

<p>Another thing is also weird. Supposing you don&#8217;t do something crazy and nuts, I think we often much less regret about things we have done than things we haven&#8217;t done. This is a very empirically based observation I&#8217;ve made and could be completely untrue. Perhaps we are simply much better at rationalizing things we did versus things we didn&#8217;t do, which I suppose is because we are much better at hypothesizing about the amazing universe it would have been IF ONLY we had done something, versus the universe that would have been IF WE HADN&#8217;T.</p>

<p>For the most part, we don&#8217;t really choose what we end up doing. That&#8217;s a fact of life that you gradually have to accept once you grow older. It&#8217;s because there are a lot of things at play: society, trends, hypes, misguided beliefs, stereotypes, opportunities.</p>

<p>This may seem a little contrary to the Will Smith video I just showed you above. This is my explanation. 21st century people, especially <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k2AbqTBxao'>North Americans</a> , I&#8217;ve come to realize, really enjoy the idea of being able to change your lives. Self help books, how-tos, DIYs are prevalent throughout society and popular culture. The doctrine that life is improvable is ingrained within the people. Will Smith is also of course one of the most successful actors in the world. Whether what he says is a result of his success or the reason of his success, no one including himself will know. These concepts benefit different people and I am one of those.</p>

<p>On a related note, there&#8217;s also something about ability right, that you do or can&#8217;t do something because you dont&#8217; have the intrinsic talent biological functions to perform them. This is where the concept of being able to improve can help certain people. It also allows us to dispel certain groups of people dispel <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=8bWlTZZN3DY'>stereotypes that they had about themselves</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#8217;s opporunity, the infamous black box you can&#8217;t look into and don&#8217;t realize you&#8217;re in. Some may argue this is just what we attribute blame to when we don&#8217;t succeed. It&#8217;s true but Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outsiders makes his claim about how environmental opportunities have dramatic effects. But I want to emphasize a point, opportunity isn&#8217;t really a black box, at least I don&#8217;t think so. The world is still controlled by humans and humans love the story of an underdog. They like to bet on unprobable prospects and that&#8217;s why I think opporunity is also something you can leverage.</p>

<p>If you go to college, you already have an opporunity that many people in the world don&#8217;t have. Our society has decided, just for the pure sake of intellectual advancement, a person will have have four years worth of time to pursue any subject of his choice to commit his studies.So you have the opportunity. If it&#8217;s someone who can do it, it&#8217;s you.</p>

<p>So now we are reaching the crux of the question: how hard do you work? how many times do you try? How much do you sacrifice before it isn&#8217;t worth it. Frankly, I don&#8217;t have an answer and I don&#8217;t think there is a universal answer. There are always numerous valid reasons for why you should do something and why you shouldn&#8217;t provided they are sufficiently motivated. I think each person has to decide for him or herself. I don&#8217;t think there is necessarily a right course of action. There&#8217;s just multiple choices and one to be made.</p>

<p>For me, it&#8217;s this. Pushing myself through all my classes just comes down to a matter of principle. I signed up for something. Regardless of how poorly I do, regardless of how long it takes, it&#8217;s myduty as student to finish something I&#8217;ve signed up for. The thing that drives me I think is not intellectual curiousity as much as a sense of responsibility. Combine that with a stubborn sense of perseverance and you have me. To my own amazement, I can push myself extremely hard.</p>

<p>What happens for me after this? What happens after school? What happens when all of those responsibilities aren&#8217;t rigid anymore. Why try so hard? What is the right balance? Do you need to aim to be the best in order to do something?</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s a legitimate question and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a good answer. It&#8217;s lazy and unproductive to just label this as a question you have to figure out for yourself. But it is. Think of all the non-#1&#8217;s in the world, the singers on youtube, the artists on deviant art. What do they think? If you&#8217;re only in it to be best, then good luck. But realistically, how many of us will become the best at what we do.</p>

<p>You to accept being bad at what you do everyday, and probably what you enjoy doing everyday. You have to be ok with being bad at your job. There&#8217;s always someone better.</p>

<p>Similarly, how do you balance the thought of being not good enough and being good enough when need be. What is the healthy mix of confidence and humility?</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and making it here. I hope this discourse was helpful. Comments please. Nothing is more encouraging then another voice in this chaotic cybersphere.</p>

    <p>Egoless programming It&#8217;s really sad when all of your code gets overwritten.</p>

<p>This is where my character steps in. I could fight it and try to fight back for my changes. But at the same time, does it matter? After the due date, the code is going to be be stored as some bits and not be used ever again anyway. So why the big fuss. It&#8217;s important to separate the criticism to you as a programmer and your code but then your code is a product of your skills as a programmer.</p>

  <a href="/2012/11/29/debug"><h2>the philosophy of debugging</h2></a>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>Dear class,</p>

<p>As you are finishing up malloc, we wanted to give a few pointers on debugging.</p>

<p>Many of you are used to using &#8220;higher level&#8221; programming languages i.e. Java, Python, Scheme which provide helpful error messages when your program crashes. That friendliness is gone when we&#8217;re using a language like C. All you will see from now on is the infamous Segmentation Fault. Typically, these are the debugging behaviors we have observed</p>

<ul>
<li>Student looks at code and doesn&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s wrong.</li>

<li>Student runs their code in gdb and knows which line the error is on and examines that line and only that line intently.</li>

<li>Student prints out the values used in that line which it segfaulted on.</li>
</ul>

<p>For bugs, and even more so with memory bugs, it will often be the case that the error is a result of an invalid operation many lines ago. This means you can&#8217;t just inspect the code where the Segfault occurred on. You have to look at more code and potentially all of the code that led to the segfault. Bugs occur when what you think wasn&#8217;t going to happen did in fact occur OR what you did think was going to happen didn&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>Thus, the philosophy of debugging is simply to CONFRONT THE FACTS.</p>

<ul>
<li>Isolate the problem, conduct a binary search on your code and find out when the bug occurs. Try to build a smaller and smaller test until you can no longer recreate your bug.</li>

<li>Find the facts and scrutinize them. Start from the smallest guarantee and build it up. Assume everything is wrong and prove that your program is right with facts.</li>

<li>Debugging means providing yourself with the context information on where the bug was created, where did things started looking fishy?</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, this translates into three things</p>

<ul>
<li>Checkers: use asserts to prove your program is right. Every assumption you make in your code should be accompanied by an assert, even if it&#8217;s as simple Do something like assert(&#8220;next block is null!&#8221; &amp;&amp; (NEXT_BLOCK(bp) != NULL)) Since assert prints itself when it fails, you can see what went wrong in words rather than just in code.</li>

<li>Print statements: provide yourself with the context information.</li>

<li>Write simple test files to recreate your bug.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formalize these debugging tools. Turn them into functions in your code which you can just use when you see another bug.</p>

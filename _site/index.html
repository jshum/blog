  <a href="/2012/12/08/remarks"><h2>remarks at the end of the semester</h2></a>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>We&#8217;re at the end of another semester already. Handed in my 29th problem set of the semester earlier today. The last one is due on Friday.</p>

<p>Just a number of observations I&#8217;ve made this semester:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve worked extremely hard this semester</li>

<li>This semester, my life has mostly consisted of me finishing problem sets and sleeping.</li>
</ul>

<p>People have commented on it. Believe it or not, it has been going on in the back of my head this whole semester. Why I&#8217;m working so hard? Here&#8217;s sort of what I&#8217;ve got now.</p>

<p>The very first question is why do? why do anything? We don&#8217;t have to at all, infact. By and large, in most of today&#8217;s societies, there is enough of a safety net to keep us alive. But the instrinsic motivation to do things exists in us because it is evolutionarily advantageous. We are alive because all of our ancestors are the ones who chose to go out and find food, to eat, to live and to survive. We are the descendants of the people of the people who wanted to live the most. Of anything, the trait to do the things needed to surivive get more and more reinforced every generation.</p>

<p>And then comes the question of purpose, right? What is the purpose of it all? None really if you ask me. But at the same time consider this, humans are the only living species who try to reason our why they are alive. For all the universe cares (if it cared at all), we are just more particles, we don&#8217;t behave deterministically. We just do things.</p>

<p>First you have to believe. But if you accept both things above and still are wondering for a reason, here&#8217;s another one.Because you are in the position to do so. For what you are about to do, thinking about doing, you are in a position to do it. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9thJm7_H68'>This</a> Will Smith interview sums up this positive gungho attitude on life pretty nicely.</p>

<p>Another thing is also weird. Supposing you don&#8217;t do something crazy and nuts, I think we often much less regret about things we have done than things we haven&#8217;t done. This is a very empirically based observation I&#8217;ve made and could be completely untrue. Perhaps we are simply much better at rationalizing things we did versus things we didn&#8217;t do, which I suppose is because we are much better at hypothesizing about the amazing universe it would have been IF ONLY we had done something, versus the universe that would have been IF WE HADN&#8217;T.</p>

<p>For the most part, we don&#8217;t really choose what we end up doing. That&#8217;s a fact of life that you gradually have to accept once you grow older. It&#8217;s because there are a lot of things at play: society, trends, hypes, misguided beliefs, stereotypes, opportunities.</p>

<p>This may seem a little contrary to the Will Smith video I just showed you above. This is my explanation. 21st century people, especially <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k2AbqTBxao'>North Americans</a> , I&#8217;ve come to realize, really enjoy the idea of being able to change your lives. Self help books, how-tos, DIYs are prevalent throughout society and popular culture. The doctrine that life is improvable is ingrained within the people. Will Smith is also of course one of the most successful actors in the world. Whether what he says is a result of his success or the reason of his success, no one including himself will know. These concepts benefit different people and I am one of those.</p>

<p>On a related note, there&#8217;s also something about ability right, that you do or can&#8217;t do something because you dont&#8217; have the intrinsic talent biological functions to perform them. This is where the concept of being able to improve can help certain people. It also allows us to dispel certain groups of people dispel <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=8bWlTZZN3DY'>stereotypes that they had about themselves</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#8217;s opporunity, the infamous black box you can&#8217;t look into and don&#8217;t realize you&#8217;re in. Some may argue this is just what we attribute blame to when we don&#8217;t succeed. It&#8217;s true but Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outsiders makes his claim about how environmental opportunities have dramatic effects. But I want to emphasize a point, opportunity isn&#8217;t really a black box, at least I don&#8217;t think so. The world is still controlled by humans and humans love the story of an underdog. They like to bet on unprobable prospects and that&#8217;s why I think opporunity is also something you can leverage.</p>

<p>If you go to college, you already have an opporunity that many people in the world don&#8217;t have. Our society has decided, just for the pure sake of intellectual advancement, a person will have have four years worth of time to pursue any subject of his choice to commit his studies.So you have the opportunity. If it&#8217;s someone who can do it, it&#8217;s you.</p>

<p>So now we are reaching the crux of the question: how hard do you work? how many times do you try? How much do you sacrifice before it isn&#8217;t worth it. Frankly, I don&#8217;t have an answer and I don&#8217;t think there is a universal answer. There are always numerous valid reasons for why you should do something and why you shouldn&#8217;t provided they are sufficiently motivated. I think each person has to decide for him or herself. I don&#8217;t think there is necessarily a right course of action. There&#8217;s just multiple choices and one to be made.</p>

<p>For me, it&#8217;s this. Pushing myself through all my classes just comes down to a matter of principle. I signed up for something. Regardless of how poorly I do, regardless of how long it takes, it&#8217;s myduty as student to finish something I&#8217;ve signed up for. The thing that drives me I think is not intellectual curiousity as much as a sense of responsibility. Combine that with a stubborn sense of perseverance and you have me. To my own amazement, I can push myself extremely hard.</p>

<p>What happens for me after this? What happens after school? What happens when all of those responsibilities aren&#8217;t rigid anymore. Why try so hard? What is the right balance? Do you need to aim to be the best in order to do something?</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s a legitimate question and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a good answer. It&#8217;s lazy and unproductive to just label this as a question you have to figure out for yourself. But it is. Think of all the non-#1&#8217;s in the world, the singers on youtube, the artists on deviant art. What do they think? If you&#8217;re only in it to be best, then good luck. But realistically, how many of us will become the best at what we do.</p>

<p>You to accept being bad at what you do everyday, and probably what you enjoy doing everyday. You have to be ok with being bad at your job. There&#8217;s always someone better.</p>

<p>Similarly, how do you balance the thought of being not good enough and being good enough when need be. What is the healthy mix of confidence and humility?</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and making it here. I hope this discourse was helpful. Comments please. Nothing is more encouraging then another voice in this chaotic cybersphere.</p>

    <p>Egoless programming It&#8217;s really sad when all of your code gets overwritten.</p>

<p>This is where my character steps in. I could fight it and try to fight back for my changes. But at the same time, does it matter? After the due date, the code is going to be be stored as some bits and not be used ever again anyway. So why the big fuss. It&#8217;s important to separate the criticism to you as a programmer and your code but then your code is a product of your skills as a programmer.</p>

  <a href="/2012/11/29/debug"><h2>the philosophy of debugging</h2></a>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>Dear class,</p>

<p>As you are finishing up malloc, we wanted to give a few pointers on debugging.</p>

<p>Many of you are used to using &#8220;higher level&#8221; programming languages i.e. Java, Python, Scheme which provide helpful error messages when your program crashes. That friendliness is gone when we&#8217;re using a language like C. All you will see from now on is the infamous Segmentation Fault. Typically, these are the debugging behaviors we have observed</p>

<ul>
<li>Student looks at code and doesn&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s wrong.</li>

<li>Student runs their code in gdb and knows which line the error is on and examines that line and only that line intently.</li>

<li>Student prints out the values used in that line which it segfaulted on.</li>
</ul>

<p>For bugs, and even more so with memory bugs, it will often be the case that the error is a result of an invalid operation many lines ago. This means you can&#8217;t just inspect the code where the Segfault occurred on. You have to look at more code and potentially all of the code that led to the segfault. Bugs occur when what you think wasn&#8217;t going to happen did in fact occur OR what you did think was going to happen didn&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>Thus, the philosophy of debugging is simply to CONFRONT THE FACTS.</p>

<ul>
<li>Isolate the problem, conduct a binary search on your code and find out when the bug occurs. Try to build a smaller and smaller test until you can no longer recreate your bug.</li>

<li>Find the facts and scrutinize them. Start from the smallest guarantee and build it up. Assume everything is wrong and prove that your program is right with facts.</li>

<li>Debugging means providing yourself with the context information on where the bug was created, where did things started looking fishy?</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, this translates into three things</p>

<ul>
<li>Checkers: use asserts to prove your program is right. Every assumption you make in your code should be accompanied by an assert, even if it&#8217;s as simple Do something like assert(&#8220;next block is null!&#8221; &amp;&amp; (NEXT_BLOCK(bp) != NULL)) Since assert prints itself when it fails, you can see what went wrong in words rather than just in code.</li>

<li>Print statements: provide yourself with the context information.</li>

<li>Write simple test files to recreate your bug.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formalize these debugging tools. Turn them into functions in your code which you can just use when you see another bug.</p>

  <div class="span8">
    <p>This thanksgiving, I elected to spend it in Washington DC with my dear friend Ian. I also managed to see JL the morning I left DC which was really unexpected and extremely nice.</p>

<p>When you reach an age like 20, you realize that the life you want to live is getting more and more different from your friends.</p>

<p>We need to start making decisions for ourselves now. There are certain nuances in situations that you just have to decide what the right thing to do is instead of hoping your friend has the right advice.</p>

<p>But then, thats what friends are right? People who understand you enough, your background, your personality, that they can give you the options to consider.</p>

<p>Although friends are different peop,e you can still treat their lives as some kind of model for you to follow.</p>

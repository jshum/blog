    <p>The reason why we shouldn&#8217;t have eugenics or any thoughts like that http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/08/there-are-no-marching-morons/</p>

<p>And no, eating brie, going to Harvard, and reading the Wall Street Journal are not indicators of ability — they are properties of class. Drinking beer, learning a trade, and reading Sports Illustrated doesn’t mean you’re dumber, or that there are genes driving your choices — it means you are the product of a particular environment. Yet we all practice this fallacy of judging someone’s intelligence by how they dress or their entertainment preferences, and society as a whole indulges in the self-fulfilling prophecy of doling out educational opportunities on the basis of economic status.</p>

<p>I know there are constraints on intelligence; there is individual variation in capacity, and there are almost certainly some biological bases for that, and also for differences in the kind of intelligence individuals express. This isn’t about that. It’s about whether there are significant differences in the distribution of the genetic constraints on human intelligence between subpopulations, and whether we are justified in writing off segments of our population as incurable morons whose progeny are similarly tainted. I say no to both.</p>

<p>The answer is always going to be education and opportunity and mobility.</p>

<p>there&#8217;s an increasing number of ideas and posts about the problems of class, or the increasing evidence of class, decreased mobility between social classes, and how that is a bad thing for everyone involved. i see that in my privileged expensive private university here. that is a growing problem</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>Unfortunate that after four years, we&#8217;re back into this rat race agian, trying to cram all of our four years of college courses and summer internships into a page worth of information.</p>

<p>Our resume gets feed into a database and then we return as results if our cv contains certain keywords that the company is looking for.</p>

<p>CV classification software engineers:</p>

<ul>
<li>strong technical skillset</li>

<li>relevant set of experiences. course project or otherwise</li>
</ul>

<p>product manager</p>

<ul>
<li>experience working with users or leading projects</li>

<li>great with people and great vision</li>
</ul>

<p>data scientist</p>

<ul>
<li>strong math background</li>

<li>working with large datasets and complex algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>Pepole have told me that you should put more about your experiences than your courses. It seems somewhat unintuitive that courses that you spend 9 months out of a year on are less important than the 3 months you spend as a part time summer emloyee. I suppose that&#8217;s because recruiters recruit from the same school, or from the same schools, which means students take the same classes more or less. All of the classes which you have taken are encoded into a numerical GPA and a small amount of resume real estate is left for the really cool courses. Of course, the courses have to be relevant to the company.</p>

<p>What differentiates you from the next person is your summer experiences and the projects you do on your own time. Courses are a given. Everything else is what differentiates you.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the thing: People who get good jobs will automatically assume they have good CV&#8217;s. But that&#8217;s not true. In fact, people who get good jobs could have very shitty CV&#8217;s but really know their shit.</p>

<p>Again, think about resumes as a screen. They&#8217;re only used for the first round ever.</p>

<p>A CV also is a fit. When they return emails, they always say if your resume is a fit. That&#8217;s where the keywords come in. For everything in life, it&#8217;s all about a fit.</p>
